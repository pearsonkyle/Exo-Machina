Therefore, spectral information about exoplanet atmospheres can be extracted by obtaining spectra of both the host and the planet. This spectral information is generally obtained by modeling, which describes the absorption of stellar radiation, and therefore includes a dimensionless parameter-space of atmospheric absorption. Therefore, a spectral signal will not necessarily be a signal of atmospheric chemistry, as long as the mass of the exoplanet is small. We derive an analytical relation to estimate the spectral signal in a planetary spectrum. We also derive an analytical expression for the impact of a density on the spectral signal.

We predict the spatial distribution and sizes of these clouds, based on a simple model of the vertical distribution of condensible, moderately reflective water vapor. Clouds of low condensate particle opacity (meta-chaotic) are predicted to be optically thick at all wavelengths, while clouds of high condensate particle opacity (strong arefundation) are predicted to be optically thin. We also predict the locations of the clouds in the atmosphere and their optical depth..."}, {"Input": "", "Output": " wavelength, the number of spectral lines is diminished by a factor of three with respect to the full intensity. The results are applied to the study of V351 Ceti, where the emission lines are found in the range of 1150-3350 \u00c5. The CO deficiency relative to the 1150-3350 \u00c5 line ratio is estimated as \u2206CO=0.03-0.01, where CO is the only major source of opacity in the stellar atmosphere. Comparisons of the relative line ratios of the CO and carbon-bearing lines are made to the solar spectrum. It is found that the relative line ratios are not sensitive to..."}, {"Input": "", "Output": ", a spectroscopic cataloguing stellar parameters for low-mass stars (M* &lt; 0.1 Msolar) is presented. It contains more than 1136 entries yielding a typical stability of about 1-2 per cent. More than 60 per cent of these are novel estimates of the stellar parameters, their uncertainties and the characteristics of the spectra. The spectra consist of 80 parts, each with a different subtype, and a series of supplementary data not previously published. A table summarizing the parallaxes is provided, together with the parameters and uncertainties. Tables 2-44 are only available in electronic form at CDS via..."}]}
