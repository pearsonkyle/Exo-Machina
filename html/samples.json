Here, we report on calculations of the atmospheric compositions of exoplanets whose atmospheres are observed in transmission using the Spitzer Space Telescope. We find that the atmospheres of exoplanets whose atmospheres are observed in transit have a range of compositions typical of the observed exoplanet compositions. We find that the atmospheric composition of exoplanets whose atmospheres are observed in transit is not a function of orbital distance from the host star, but that the composition of exoplanetary atmospheres is largely determined by their orbital distance from the host star.

The discovery was based on radial velocity (RV) measurements obtained with the Hobby- and Keck-IHIRES spectrographs. Our analysis shows that the RV signal is dominated by the presence of the planet and the presence of an additional, longer period signal. An additional, longer period signal is also present in the Keck data but is not statistically significant.

As a result, the abundance ratios inferred in the literature can vary by at least an order of magnitude from the values observed in the Sun. The abundances derived for the units of ice and water are indicative of ice and water being the dominant parent of the ice and water in the solar nebula.\nContext.

We consider two different cases: planets around a Sun-like star and planets around a M dwarf. We also investigate the occurrence rate of Jupiter analogues around M dwarfs. We find that the rotational period of the planet around a M dwarf can be as large as one Jupiter year which can lead to a higher probability of an Earth-like atmosphere around the planet. Theoretical calculations indicate that the atmosphere of the planet around the M dwarf can be strongly influenced by the atmospheric composition and the flux received by the planet.

To resolve the issue of the stability of moons around exoplanets and thus determine the moons' ability to host habitable moons, we searched for moons around the 10 most massive exoplanets in our sample. We identified that, for each planet, the moons around that planet may have different stability characteristics.

Starting from the principle that a signal is a mixture of the two most likely candidates, we investigate the algorithm's parameters, which are selected from the chance that a signal is a mixture of the two most likely candidates. We show that for any signal, we can identify which of the two most likely candidates is the signal based on the likelihood of the mixture. We apply this algorithm to photometric light curves of the transiting exoplanet HAT-P-11b obtained by CoRoT and Kepler.

In the same way as for CO2, the oxygenated chains are subject to thermal burning, whereas the other chains react only in the gas phase. The most significant difference is that the CO2 reaction is driven by the compression of the vapor to the solid in the gas phase. The CO2 reaction is also the major controlling factor for the formation of the tholins.\nThe history of planet formation is one of the most interesting and deep mysteries in astrophysics.

The effective atmospheric pressure in the atmosphere is when the planet is at the planet's orbital distance, the atmospheric temperature is lower than the planetary equilibrium temperature and the planetary radius is smaller than the Earth-Sun radius. The spectra of exoplanets with a reflection spectrum are dominated by absorption by cloud particles since the reflection spectrum is based on scattering by the atmospheric aerosols. But the influence of thermal emission by planetary IR emission is important, since it depends on planetary atmospheric composition and the planetary orbital distance. The effect of the planetary thermal emission is investigated by means of a nonlocal thermodynamic equation of state (EOS) model, which is used to calculate the reflectivity of a red planet atmosphere. We find that the effect of thermal emission by planets on the reflected thermal spectra depends on the planetary optical thickness and surface temperature, and on the planetary mass and orbital"}, {"Input": "Thermal emission observations of terrestrial planets are the only way to determine", "Output": "Thermal emission observations of terrestrial planets are the only way to determine the composition of their atmospheres.

We show that the time-scale for the formation of dust grains is typically shorter than the mass-to-flux ratio (m/f) of the gas, and thus the grains can form via rapid accretion or gravitational fragmentation. We use this result to infer that the accumulation of grains at the snowline of circumstellar discs is suppressed by the gas pressure gradient. This reduces the fraction of the grains which remain at the snowline, resulting in a reduction in the gas-to-gas mass ratio at the snowline. We also show that the mass accretion process which forms the snowline and which is driven by the gas pressure gradient, is insensitive to the diameter of the gas disc. We find that the time-scale for gas accretion onto the disc and for grain growth, the mass explosion and fragmentation, are uncorrelated.

However, the telescopes equipped to observe the Sun have also been used to measure their chromospheric activity. In this work, we present the results obtained by two independent telescopes on the same stellar system. The 2.5 m telescope was used to observe the chromospheric activity of the Sun during a short-duration burst of activity, while the 3 m telescope was used to observe the chromospheric activity of the Sun during a longer-duration burst of activity. In our study, which was performed before the two independent telescopes, we found that the activity of the Sun was quite stable during the entire burst of activity. It was observed from the ground and the 3 m telescope allowed us to observe the chromospheric activity of the Sun during a short-duration burst of activity.\nAims: We attempt to search for high-amplitude periodicities in the photometric light curves"}, {"Input": "", "Output": "We report the discovery of two new transiting hot Jupiters: (1) a hot Jupiter (M = 0.55 \u00b1 0.06 MJup, R = 1.24 \u00b1 0.08 RJup) orbiting a V = 11.5, G5V star with a mass of M* = 0.67 \u00b1 0.05 M\u2609 and R* = 1.04 \u00b1 0.07 R\u2609 and radius of R* = 1.260 \u00b1 0.043 R\u2609 and (2) a hot Neptune (M = 0.45 \u00b1 0.11 MJup, R = 1.14 \u00b1 0.08 RJup) orbiting a V = 12.3, G5V star with a mass of M* = 0.71 \u00b1 0.05 M\u2609 and R* = 0.72 \u00b1 0.06 R\u2609 and radius of R* = 1.029 \u00b1 0.066 R\u2609.

In this paper we study the formation of extrasolar planets which are formed via core accretion. In particular, we consider whether the formation of hydrogen-helium planets is possible. To do this, we use the core accretion model developed by K. Einstein and A.K. Verges, which is able to solve for the disk angular momentum and to compute the disk mass. We find that the disk mass can be estimated using the disk mass function. We also consider whether the accretion process can be implemented in a disk which is a two-component disk. We find that the disk angular momentum can be supplied either in a monotonic fashion for small disks or by a quasi-periodic process.

The planet's atmosphere is likely dominated by clouds, and the mass loss rate from the planet is estimated to be unlikely to be sufficient to explain its cloudy appearance. We infer a planet-to-star radius ratio of 0.117. This value differs from the value of 0.014 found by previous studies, which assumed that the planet is covered in bright clouds. This result suggests that the planet is probably surrounded by a disk.Based on observations made with the"}, {"Input": "", "Output": "We report the detection of a second candidate transiting planet in the CoRoT-7 system: CoRoT-7b. The light curve above is dominated by transits of the planet, and the corresponding light curves are observed by the CoRoT satellite. We found that the planet has an orbital period of 4.21 days, a radius of 1.19 \u00b1 0.05RJ, and a mass of 0.51 \u00b1 0.05MJ, making it the most compact planet known to date. The planet, with a mass of 0.82 \u00b1 0.17MJ and an orbital period of 2.09 days, is at the outer edge of the radius valley, which separates hot Jupiters from the rest of the population of compact planets. The planet is one of the few known examples of a planet with a relatively low eccentricity (e \u2248 0.15), and its orbit is one of the few that is well aligned with the stellar spin (\u03bb = -22\u00b0).

We use the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) 7 cm continuum to trace the CO emission from the protostellar disk around the young star LQ Hya. The disk is cold and its morphology is consistent with a detailed model, where the dust is found to be dominated by the CO+CO2+CO3+CO2+CO3/2+CO2+CO2 series. The ALMA observations reveal the hot gas in the inner disk that is dominated by CO gas within 200 AU of the central protostar and which emits in emission at a wavelength of 0.8 mm. The temperature is a few times larger than that of the cold gas. The CO emission is resolved through the CO2+CO3+CO gas-phase transition and its duration is \u224810-100 yr. The gas-phase line profiles are not fit well by a single gas line at the temperature of the ALMA observations, but a double gas line at the temperature of the gas-phase transition is suggested."}, {"Input": "", "Output": "The CME (Coronal Mass Extinction) in a planet's magnetosphere is an important and widely debated subject. Here, we use the time-averaged magnetospheric EPSC (Extrasolar Plane Spectra) to study the electrostatic and plasma properties of magnetospheric CMEs on Jupiter, and on Saturn, for the purposes of understanding the composition and abundance of the magnetospheric plasma environment. We find that Jupiter's magnetospheric CMEs are dominated by high-energy electrons, and that in the Saturnian magnetosphere, the CME mass is strongly regulated by the electron density and temperature structure. An increase in the plasma mass leads to a decrease in the plasma temperature, and thus an increase in the CME density. The CME density distribution is dependent on the particle size and electron distribution. We use the time-averaged magnetic field spectra of Jupiter and Saturn to study the electron population in the Saturnian magnetosphere, and to study the chemical evolution of magnetospheric plasma. We find that the average plasma temperature and free-fall velocity are higher in the Saturnian magnetosphere than in the Jupiter magnetosphere, with the largest increases occurring at the electron density peak.

We describe a new near-infrared (NIR) intra-stellar absorption technique that can be used to obtain data from the core-accretion phase, where electrons are concentrated in the inner disk regions.

We report on the frequency and properties of the source, which is located in the Taurus Molecular Cloud.\nWe report the results of an investigation of the dust properties of the upper main sequence (LSP) star HD 73526, which hosts a planetary system composed of two planets with a semimajor axis of 9.66 days and a period of 3.64 days. To characterize the physical properties of the HD 73526 planets we obtained the first NIR spectroscopic observables (fluxes, and line fluxes) with the VLT/SPHERE high-resolution polarimeter.

The radial velocity observations were carried out with the ESPaDOnS and NARVAL spectrographs mounted on the 3.6 m telescope at ESO's VLT. In this work, we report the discovery of eclipsing M-type binaries and the detection of Doppler signals in a sample of 31 M dwarfs. We find that the fraction of M dwarfs with detectable Doppler signals is 57%, in agreement with previous studies. In addition, the fraction of M dwarfs with detectable Doppler signals increases slightly with the total number of companions, suggesting that the frequency of Doppler detections may be overestimated in the sample of low-mass stars. We identify two new M dwarfs that have Doppler signatures that are unexpected in light of the observational data. Approximately one-fourth of the stars have one or more Doppler signatures that are not expected in a classical M-type star. Given that the Doppler signatures are unexpected, we investigate whether the present Doppler signatures are the result of instrumental effects or intrinsic variability. We discuss a possible explanation for the current Do"}, {"Input": "", "Output": "1. We confirm the planetary nature of a second, lower mass companion to the low-mass M-dwarf star GJ 581, previously reported in HST/WFPC2. We use the Hipparcos (HIP) and Gaia (GALAH) astrometric data together with the radial velocities from the Keck HIRES spectrograph to determine the orbit of the companion. We find that the companion is a brown dwarf, with a mass M=0.07+/-0.07 M\u2609 and a radius R=0.11+/-0.07 R\u2609. The absence of radial velocity sensitivity at shorter timescales, like those seen in HST/WFPC2, suggests that the companion is not in a low-eccentricity orbit. The companion's orbit in two epochs, one with and one without the planetary companion, is consistent with zero eccentricity. The measured semi-major axis of the orbit is 2.06+/-0.03 AU. The orbital inclination of the planet, 0.74+/-0.07, is consistent with zero. We conclude that the companion is a brown dwarf, with a mass Mabout 0"}]}
