Our results show that there is a strong correlation between the transit depth and the duration, but not between the transit duration and the depth. The search for a decrease in the transit duration is strongly biased towards transit duration durations that are significantly longer than the search for increase in the transit duration.\nWe present a detailed analysis of a planetary transit timing variation (TTV) observed by Kepler of K2-293 b, a close-in extrasolar planet in a nearly circular orbit with a mass of \u223c8.6 M_J, in the K2 Campaign 14 field, using the NN-Selection algorithm. We report the discovery of two TTVs, one with a period of 6.2 s and one with a period of 390 d. The TTVs have a general period and do not exhibit any apparent period offset, which suggests that they are not due to transit timing variations. We also find that the stellar mass and radius are significantly larger than predicted by theoretical models. Our analysis also reveals a transit timing variation with a period of 9.6 d and a semiamplitude of Kp= 4.10 \u00b1 0.04 m s-1, which is consistent with an orbital period of 9.1 d. The TTVs are not statistically significant and are designed to constrain the planetary mass and orbital inclination.

In this paper, the first detailed study of the interaction between the stellar wind and the planetary atmosphere, we consider the effect of stellar wind radiation pressure on planetary magnetospheric and cometary plasma flow. The stellar wind radiation pressure can be currently modelled by the so-called stellar wind acoustic loss efficiency, the loss of magnetic energy due to the interaction between the stellar wind and the planetary atmosphere. In this paper, we investigate the loss efficiency of stellar wind radiation pressure using numerical simulations. We find that the stellar wind radiation pressure is proportional to the stellar wind acoustic loss efficiency and the ratio of the stellar wind and planetary atmospheric losses can be determined by this study. We then consider the effect of a planetary magnetic field on the stellar wind radiation pressure, and we find that the magnetic field of a typical Jupiter-mass planet is insufficient to modulate the stellar wind radiation pressure. We conclude that the planetary magnetic field is responsible for the large variation in the stellar wind radiation pressure.\nWe present results from our Spitzer analysis of the multi-planet system HD 106906, which has one of the shortest orbital periods and the smallest eccentricities among the extrasolar planetary systems.

We have modeled the two planets by transiting their host star, and compared them with a reference star of the same magnitude and effective temperature. We have also modeled the stellar limb darkening from a point source in the same system, and compared the light curves to light curves of the same reference star. We have found an empirical correlation between the light curves of the two planets and their stellar photometric properties: the planet is brighter in the day side than the star. This is due to the stellar limb darkening. We have found a correlation between the transit depth and the stellar radius: the greater the transit depth, the larger the stellar radius. Results: In our simulations, we have modeled the light curves of two Jupiter-like planets and a Jupiter-like planet, and obtained light curves for them with the simultaneous presence of light curves of the Earth and a Jupiter-like planet.

We study the effect of radiative-convective equilibrium in a general model for the gas temperature, radiative-convective boundary conditions and radiative-convective boundary conditions, which include radiative-convective heating and cooling, and consider the effects of different initial values for the temperature, radiative-convective boundary conditions and radiative-convective heating and cooling. Our results show that the initial radiative-convective temperature is mainly determined by the unperturbed radiative-convective temperature, but the dependence of radiative-convective heating and cooling on the stellar mass can vary significantly. The initial radiative-convective heating and cooling values depend on the assumed stellar mass. In particular, we find that the temperature increases with increasing stellar mass, and thus the initial radiative-convective heating and cooling may vary significantly due to changes in stellar mass. We also find that the initial radiative-convective heating and cooling is strongly coupled with the stellar surface activity.

The aim is to study the formation of planetary embryos embedded in a transition disk that has been unstable for a long time, and to determine if the evolution of the disk during the disk lifetime is determined by the disk's mass and age. We developed a new code that has been applied to the disk instability model, and compare it to other disk instability models. We find that the disk instability model is able to reproduce the behavior of the disk during the disk lifetime more well than other models. We have also compared the results of two different simulations in which the disk is assumed to have a constant mass and time scale. We find that the disk instability model produces a large mass transfer within the disk that increases the system age relative to the value found in previous simulations.

We use a thermodynamic equilibrium (E) model to study the formation of a globally-temperature (T) planetary atmosphere. We show that the planetary atmosphere is formed by a super-critical convection and spiral-like halo, with cool spots at the equator and warm regions at the poles. The origin of the hot spots and warm regions is not yet fully understood, and the composition of the atmosphere depends on the initial composition and on the gravity of the planet. The composition of the atmosphere is determined by the initial composition of the planetary atmosphere and the composition of the stellar composition. The warm climate region is close to the equator, but we show that the cold climate regions cannot be determined. The temperature of the atmosphere is not solely a function of the stellar composition. We find that the effects of the stellar composition and the initial composition of the atmospheres on the planetary composition can be removed through a combination of a low-pressure (P) atmosphere and a high-pressure (H) atmosphere. We show that the unexpected solid-to-gas ratio of super-Earths indicates that the planetary atmosphere is likely composed of a mixture of H and P molecules.

The radiative forcing has the largest effect on the global mean temperature, the mean cloud opacity, and cloud-free stratospheric albedo.

The optical properties of planetary atmospheres are widely of different origins. The Sun is an example of a star with a very rich spectrum of stellar and planetary systems. Aims: We investigate the photometric properties of the primary star that hosts an extrasolar planet in a close-in orbit. Then we study the atmospheric transport on this planet through the influence of its host star's magnetic field. Methods: We performed 1D MHD simulations of the formation and orbital evolution of the planet and its nearby and eccentric orbit for different initial conditions and magnetic field configurations, and calculated the final, observed and calculated spectra. We also investigated the effect of stellar wind conditions on the planetary atmosphere. Results: We find that the planet has a high probability of remaining in a close-in orbit close to its host star but it is unlikely that the planet will sustain this orbit in the long run. The radial velocity of the planet is generally subsonic, with a maximum of \u2272200 km s-1. This is consistent with the subsonic velocity of the stellar wind, which is responsible for the orbital circularization. The planet's orbit is eccentric and inclined to the star's equatorial plane, and it has a low probability of circularizing before the stellar wind knocks it off the surface. The planet has a low-density atmosphere but a very high density drift, implying a high mass-loss rate.

The stellar limb darkening is weak, and the stellar surface density profile is not determined by the planet. We use the Gaussian process method to predict the parameters of the light curve. The parameters are extracted as a function of the stellar radius and luminosity. The results are compared with the observational solutions that can be obtained from the light curve.

Combining our results with those of Kohn et al. (2012), we find that the CO2 D3H2 spectra vary significantly with wavelength, particularly at the high edge of the 1.0-1.5\u03bcm band. We combine our results with previous H2O absorption measurements in the literature to infer the ratio of CO2D to D3H2 gas densities in the 1.0-1.5\u03bcm band, and conclude that this ratio is most likely not a function of pressure but rather a function of temperature. We also find that the CO2D spectra are largely uniform over the whole band, with a peak at about 0.55 cm-1, which corresponds to the 0.1-1.0 \u03bcm band. We interpret this signal as evidence for a nonuniform temperature distribution over the CO2D band. We explore the implications of this result for the CO2D absorption depth, and determine that a uniform temperature distribution is unlikely.\nWe investigate the effect of disk flow on the surface brightness of a 2D Gaussian disk model on the disk surface density.

The role of the different observables and the distribution of their parameters, particularly the period and density distributions of the two modes, is discussed. A comparison of the estimated values with results from previous studies and with results from a Monte Carlo simulation is also made.\nUnbiased frequency analysis of Kepler data is particularly sensitive to the presence of close-in exoplanets, and we find that the results for the two most common types of exoplanets, gas giants and small planets, are correlated. Large planets are generally more abundant around more massive stars, and they have a significant share in the frequency peaks of the low frequency Kepler. This suggests that they are the main contributors to the low frequency Kepler population. Small planets have a small but significant share of the low frequency Kepler population. Their frequency peaks are dominated by the low frequency Kepler population. The best candidates for transit candidates in the low frequency Kepler population are gas giants with the largest radius.\nWe present Kepler photometric transit observations of the hot Jupiter HAT-P-4b. We observed the planet in four passbands: red, J, H and Ks with a median precision of \u223c4 millimagnitudes (mmag). The transit was found to be well fit by a flat-field method and two different fits were found: a power-law model and a Gaussian model.

We find that the eclipse depth decreases to a value consistent with previous work but that the reduction is significant for a planet with a reduced thermal emission. We refine our previous estimate of the planet's mass-loss rate from WASP-12b by taking into account the lower planetary mass-loss density and weaker planetary gravity. We also find that the eclipse depth in the 5.8 \u03bcm band is due to the strength of the night side's emission at that wavelength. Our results support a generally consistent scenario for the photochemical evolution of hot Jupiters. We detect a secondary eclipse signal with a depth of 0.118% \u00b1 0.005% in the 3.6 \u03bcm band. The eclipse depth is consistent with the day/night emission that was previously detected at 3.6 \u03bcm with a depth of 0.0008% \u00b1 0.005%.

We performed a spectrum synthesis and photometric analysis of the data to obtain constraints on the stellar parameters and abundances of the background BDs and BD+MMS. Results: We find that the BDs and BD+MMS are well correlated, as they are found to be distributed over the whole optical region (R about  60,000) and the BD+MMS is stronger than the BD-MMS by about one part in 10. We find a weak, non-detection in the optical of the BD-MMS, in contrast to the BD+MMS of the background BDs and the background BDs of the two Taurus stars.

We obtain millimeter spectra of the protoplanetary disks around TW Hya and \u03b2 Pictoris, which are both thought to have undergone significant clearing by their stellar companion, and at least two other disks with dust emission, for comparison. The presence of dust in these disks indicates that dust grains in the planet-forming region need to be large. We find that the dust is distributed radially, with a total disk mass of \u223c70-80 MJup in TW Hya and \u223c30 MJup in \u03b2 Pictoris. This represents higher than predicted by recent simulations of dust growth in disks with a pre-existing planet in the vicinity of 10 au. We also find that the disk surface density profile in the planet-forming region is well-fitted by a single power law with index \u223c-1.5 and 0.1, which represents the same as the disk surface density profile in the protoplanetary region. This suggests that the disk surface density reflects the radial extent of grain growth and that the disk surface density profile is directly related to the region of grain growth.\nWe present a model of the evolution of protoplanetary disks with respect to the stellar wind and the planet formation process, including the dust evolution in the disk during the gas disk phase and toward the outer disk during the planet formation process. The disk gas mass is initialized by the formation of a circumplanetary disk in the outer disk that is magnetically coupled to the outer disk. The gas disk mass is recovered from the surface of the disk by the inward migration of the disk disk gas.

We model the optical depth of CO and H2CO lines in the disk using a three-dimensional (3D) radiative transfer code and calculate their 3D structure and line intensities. We then apply the gas-phase radiative transfer code to obtain the gas distribution and the dust- and gas-phase opacities in galaxies with a wide range of ages. By computing the dust-gas mass ratio, we can constrain the early disk evolution models. Our results indicate that CO and H2CO are unlikely to provide strong constraints on the early disk evolution for protoplanetary disks. However, they can help constrain the disk gas phase models.

We find that the satellite fractionation at the satellite level is rather slow. It is caused by the fact that the final payload mass is fixed at the launch date. For an increased launch date the satellite fractionation is faster because the payload mass increases as the launch date progresses. We propose a mechanism to increase the payload mass. The satellite combination time that the mission is given is the payload mass, and the alternative, where the payload mass is fixed at the launch date, is not very attractive. We also show that the satellite fractionation can be sustained during the mission.\nWe estimate the fraction of stars with planets as a function of their masses and radii.

In this work, we explore the possibility of the existence of stable close disks between the ages of 5-40 Myr, which is the age range of the Solar System. We consider the evolution of the circumstellar disks as a function of the mass and orbital properties of planets. We find that, in the disk-wide regime, disks evolve toward a steady state.

In this work, we explore the parameter space of transits, and the complementary effects that the planet's emission spectrum may have on the transit light curve, by employing the Random Forests algorithm to recover the planetary emission spectrum. We show that for typical exoplanets, the stellar limb-darkening, and planetary mass-radius relationships can be well approximated by our reconstruction method. However, the planet's orbit, well as the planet's obliquity, can have a significant effect, causing significant deviations between the two-way relationship. This violation may cause a systematic bias in the determined planet/star radius ratios. We explain the systematic bias by invoking a nonlinear law which is deduced from the assumption that the planet's emission spectrum is strongly affected by the planetary orbit. We construct a theoretical analysis to show that, although the reason for the deviation between the two light curves is not clear, the effect of the stellar limb darkening on the planetary light curve can be deduced from the analysis of the light curve data.

We apply this technique to a sample of iron-peak absorption lines observed by the CoRoT satellite, which yields a spectral-line shape for each line. We then combine this with a new, more accurate, method for estimating the intrinsic stellar radius. We find that the stellar radius is predicted to be a function of the effective temperature of the star, its mass, and the radius of the planet in the 2\u03c3 (1-loop) frame. The stellar radius can be divided into a hydrogen-rich core (1.1 R\u2609) and a hydrogen-poor core (0.50 R\u2609).

With this in mind, we study the evolution of the planetary system around Proxima-like disks using our N-body code. We find that the protoplanetary disk is likely to be fragmented, leading to the formation of planets in the habitable zone of Proxima-like disks. However, because Proxima-like disks are not gravitationally stable, a binary system can still form and evolve. This binary system then becomes unstable when the protoplanetary disk is fragmented, resulting in the formation of planets in the habitable zone of the disk.

We perform N-body simulations, which include gas accretion, migration, and planetesimal formation, in which the planetesimals are modeled as hot super Jupiters. The initial conditions are slightly eccentric and the planetesimals are assumed to be uniformly distributed about a unit mass planet. The initial conditions are also slightly eccentric and the initial planetesimals are assumed to be uniformly distributed about a unit mass planet. The planetesimals are assumed to form in one giant impact region after another, each one being composed of rock-like cores and water-rich cores. Each impact region is then subdivided into sub-impact zones where the rock-like cores are composed of individual minerals. The model allows us to study the growth, drift, and orbital evolution of the planetesimals because of their collisional and gravitational interactions with the planet. We find that for a standard impact model, collisional fragmentation occurs in the outer impact zones. However, in the model with the water-rich core over a wide range of parameters, we also find fragmentation in the impact zone. The magnitude of fragmentation depends on the size of the planetesimal disk and the initial mass and orbital location of the planet.

Our simulations do not show a strong dependence on the mass of the disk or the distance from the star. We also find that the gas accretion rate onto the disk increases with the protostar mass. The surface density profile evolves to a steady state that is well described by the power law of lenght 1.4 for a planet with a semimajor axis of 0.1 AU and an orbital distance of 3 AU.

Here we present a study of how the formation of planetary systems affects the embryos' orbital distributions. We run N-body simulations to study the orbital evolution of embryos in a protoplanetary disk with a large initial mass fraction. Our results indicate that the number of embryos that form depends on the disk mass and the initial disk surface density profile, and that the embryos' orbital separations can be larger or smaller than those in the disk model. We also find that in the case where the disk mass is small, the embryos' orbital separations can be larger than those in the disk model, but not by a significant amount. This means that the embryos cannot form in the disk within the disk lifetime.

Here, we present a new approach by considering the orbital evolution of planets around binary stars. In a three-dimensional zero-velocity stellar evolution model, we have numerically integrated the binary orbits for planets that orbit the binary star with the mass ratio of q = 10-3 and the semimajor axis of the binary relative to our Sun. We have then compared the results with the results of a previous two-dimensional (or three-dimensional) stellar evolution model that incorporates the effects of tidal circularization. The results of the two-dimensional stellar evolution model agree fairly well with each other and with the results of the three-dimensional stellar evolution model, although the two-dimensional model is slightly over-excited. We find that our two-dimensional stellar evolution model can reproduce the orbital evolution of planets in the HZ around binary stars well, but only for q &gt; 1.3. In contrast, the three-dimensional stellar evolution model reproduces the orbital evolution of planets around binary stars well, but underpredicts the orbital evolution of planets around binary stars due to excess in the tidal heating rate.

The disk is fully three-dimensional, with a continuous-radius, and uniform mass distribution. The collision-driven growth is essentially complete for collisional time-scales of 10-100 ms, while the third-order growth is substantially slower. The time-dependent disk structure is then computed by applying the growth-time effect to the collisional time-scales. We find that only around half of the total disk mass is formed at the end of the simulations. The remaining mass can be accreted by the disk over the disk lifetime at the mass of the planet and the disk mass can be accreted by the disk only over a very narrow radius of the planet. We also find that the disk structure is highly nonuniformly distributed over the three plane radii.

We then calculate the migration time-scales of the protoplanets and planetesimals for different values of the protoplanet's eccentricity and inclination, as well as the initial nebula size and the distance of the planetesimals from the planet. We find that the migration time-scales are significantly longer than the nebula size for a given value of the protoplanet's eccentricity and inclination. This means that the accretion rate is not a limiting step in the formation of gas giants. However, when the mass of the planetesimals is large, the migration time-scales become longer than the nebula size. This may limit the growth of gas giants.\nWe report the discovery of six new transiting hot Jupiters by the K2 mission: K2-42b, K2-43b, K2-44b, K2-46b, K2-47b, and K2-48b.

The simulation assumes that the disk is optically thick at all times. For this reason, the planet mass is governed by the properties of the disk at a fixed mass. We consider a wide range of disk properties, focusing on a specific case in which the gas disk is optically thick. The number of planets depends on the disk mass and mass accretion rates. We find that in this case, the pre-gas nebula disk mass is nearly independent of mass accretion rates and the mass of the planet. The total disk mass increases only weakly with gas accretion rates, and the disk mass can be very low if all accretion is performed through a gap. However, if gas accretion is strongly limited, then the disk mass can be significantly higher than the nebula disk mass, and the nebula disk mass can be significantly larger than the gas disk mass. This is due to the larger disk mass and the smaller gas mass required to form the planet. The results also indicate that the gas disk mass can be very high and that gas accretion rates initially scale very low, then increase rapidly with accretion rates."}, {"Input": "Observations of GJ 1214 b suggest cloud are present", "Output": "Observations of GJ 1214 b suggest cloud are present.\nWe present Model-InchNet (MI) to compute the Keplerian orbital parameters and masses of planets in the Kepler field.

Methods: We performed N-body simulations of the interaction between a gas giant protoplanet and a disk gas. The gas giant was assumed to form in a disc that was initially circular. The disk was initially extended and its outer regions become tilted to the planet's orbital plane. The planet's disk initially has a gas content of 0.09 M\u2609 and inhomogeneous grain abundance.

We find that tidal disruption can lead to atmospheric escape and planets with Earth-like atmospheres can evolve to planets with mass comparable to that of the Earth, and therefore they could be habitable. However, when the planet crosses the planetary instability region, atmospheric escape decreases significantly as the planet crosses the instability region. If the planet is tidally disrupted, atmospheric escape can be strongly suppressed, and the atmosphere can escape completely. However, the atmospheric escape rate is sensitive to the planet\u2019s mass and the stellar wind conditions, and the effect of tidal disruption can be difficult to estimate from the observed exoplanet population.\nWe present the first results of a multi-year effort to monitor the brightness of a large portion of the M-dwarf source star (\u223c500 arcsec) with the Magellan/Clay Telescope (MCAT).

In the core accretion scenario, a merger of two planets formed by that process results in a compact system with a few planets between the resonances. We show that the dynamical evolution is different for different types of resonances that can be expected from the core accretion scenario.

We study the evolution of systems composed of two massive planets, where the planets are initially placed in resonance and migrate by means of secular perturbation. In particular, we investigate the evolution of resonant systems as a function of the mass ratio and planet mass of the planets. In this work, we consider the formation of a single resonant system in the mass range 0.2 to 1.0, for which the resonant pair is initially separated by 0.2. We show that the evolution of this type of system is controlled by the planet mass and the initial location of the planets in the resonance. The final system architecture is determined by the distribution of the initial planet masses relative to the semi-major axis of the resonant pair. Our results indicate that the evolution of resonant systems is determined by the initial planet mass ratio when the initial planet masses are equal. We also find that the initial eccentricity of the resonant pair is not limited by the eccentricity of the initial pair, but can be affected by the initial planet mass ratio.

We present a new method for the determination of the sky-projected obliquity through the analysis of the radial velocity curves of the binary systems. We show that the sky-projected obliquity \u220a(S - \u03bb) can be used as a tool to constrain the eccentricity of binary systems. We also present the results of the study of the sky-projected satellite-projected obliquity \u220a(S - \u03bb). We find that the satellite-projected obliquity \u220aS is not always a reliable value of \u03bb. For example, in the case where the binary orbit has a unique alignment, it is possible to reach the value \u220a(S - \u03bb) \u220aS = 0, but only if the satellite-projected obliquity \u220aS is not an unknown quantity.

The model includes all of the dynamical effects of the planet's orbit, including the effect of the orbital motion relative to the disk. We find that the heat flux from the disk is always equal to the heat flux from the atmosphere. In the 2-4 AU region, the disk is always aligned with respect to the stellar equator. The orbit is always inclined relative to the stellar equator. The disk mass decreases with distance from the disk, but the disk inclination is always small. We explore the effect of a planet's orbit relative to the disk and find that the disk inclination is always small, and that the disk mass increases with distance from the star. We find that the disk mass is always correlated with the stellar mass. The disk mass correlates with the stellar mass if the planet is at an orbital location far from the disk center.

It is shown that the Tautenburg limit is formed by a combination of a finite-volume equation and an equation of state with a finite-volume solution. Specifically, the limits on the pressure and temperature are set by the finite-volume solution and the equation of state. The finite-volume equation is used to derive the pressure, Tautenburg, and temperature from the finite-volume equation, and the finite-volume solution is then used to formulate the pressure and temperature.

The stellar mass is 1.091 \u00b1 0.048 Rsolar, which implies a ratio of XO-3b's orbital period to its Roche orbital radius of 1.426 \u00b1 0.091.

It is also found that the Io satellite rotates about 0.5 AU slower than the planet's orbital period, which explains the discrepancy often quoted in the literature between satellite cross-over measurements and the prediction from the Kepler spacecraft. Finally, the thermal structure of the atmosphere is studied by means of the effect of the rotation of the planet on the thermal structure of the atmosphere.

We use these results to map the albedo of the planet's atmosphere. We find that the temperatures of the prominences are much higher than those of the surrounding planets, which is in agreement with the hypothesis that an atmosphere can be stable if the temperature is kept low (for example, if the planet is near the tropopause). We also explore how the polarizations change with time, and whether a second prominence strongly influences the polarizations. We find that the polarizations are nonuniform, and that the temperature at the prominence usually increases with time. We consider the hypothesis that the prominences are caused by the rotation of the planet. We find that the prominences are not caused by the rotation of the planet; their presence is instead inferred from the apparent absence of significant latitudinal heating.

The pre-main sequence (PMS) phase is important for the chemical and dynamical evolution of protoplanetary disks. Aims: We study the evolution of the PMS disk with a focus on the formation of dust grains. Methods: We use a direct integration method to model the evolution of the PMS disk from the pre-main sequence to the PMS trough at the end of the PMS. Results: We find that dust grains are formed at the end of the PMS in the absence of any stellar heating. They can be transported to the PMS on a time scale of about 1 Myr. The gas flow is dominated by the radial drift of dust grains. Dust fragmentation is not important for the growth of dust grains. The gas flow is dominated by the radial drift of dust grains via the drag of the stellar wind. The radial drift of dust grains is the dominant process for the formation of dust grains in the disk. The mass deposition of grains is negligible at the disk midplane. However, they may contribute to the radial drift of dust grains through the gas flow.

Here, we analyze the SED of a star with a massive (Mp = 1.5-2.5 Msolar) disk of circumstellar dust. We find that the disk is optically thick in the X-rays, which is consistent with previous studies. The SED is dominated by strong optical absorbers (TiO and VO), and the circumstellar dust is not present at low photospheric temperatures (\u2272500 K). The circumstellar dust is strongly oriented in the X-rays, which indicates that it is not an artifact created by an outer planet. We also find that the circumstellar dust is much more extended in the X-rays than in the other two modes of emission (scattering and thermal). This suggests that the circumstellar dust emission is the result of an interaction between the disk wind and the low-mass planet. We also find that the thermal emission is dominated by the X-rays. The circumstellar dust is likely to be optically thick in the X-rays, so that the scattering phase is still not fully taken into account. The X-rays have a weak influence on the thermal emission, but the influence of the disk wind is clear.\nAims: The aim of this paper is to investigate the formation of dust disks around massive stars and the dependence of the disk mass and the age of the host star on the mass ratio and the binary mass ratio. <BR />Methods: We used cross-correlation techniques to search for correlations between the spectral energy distribution of the disk and the luminosity. <BR />Results: We find a correlation between the disk mass and the binary mass ratio that is not statistically significant, although a weak correlation is obtained for a high-mass star and a weak correlation is obtained for a low-mass star.

The resulting smog is inhomogeneous and easily changes its nature. We study the dependence of the haze opacity on the formation and growth process of dust grains. We find that dust grains are formed in the gas phase of the disk around a central star at radii where the dust opacity is large and the gas temperature is low. These grains grow through collisions in the disk, and in the absence of dust growth, they become trapped in the smog at radii where the gas temperature is high. The gas flow is inhomogeneous, and gas particles that are trapped in the smog can migrate inward and become trapped in small open gaps. The open gaps can be inhomogeneous in size and shape. This leads to a multitude of observed dust grains in the disk that are trapped in the smog and that can contribute to its evolution.\nWe use high-resolution near-infrared (NIR) Herschel observations to study the distribution of dust emission around a sample of nearby young stars. We find a strong evidence of the existence of three distinct populations: (1) a population of optically thin, optically thick emission extending from about 0.3'' to about 0.5'' in radius at all radii, (2) a population of optically thick, optically thin emission extending from about 0.3'' to about 0.5'' in radius at all radii, and (3) a population of optically thin, optically thick emission extending from about 0.3'' to about 0.5'' in radius at all radii. We speculate that the three populations are distinguished by their different physical properties, such as their composition, internal structure, and evolutionary status. The three populations are also distinguished by their estimated distance from the galactic plane. Each population is therefore expected to have a different size distribution. The dust properties in the three populations are also used to constrain models of dust emission, including dust evolution, and we use this constraining to test these models with data from other surveys. We find"}, {"Input": "The formation of photochemical hazes creates", "Output": "The formation of photochemical hazes creates an asymmetric dust distribution, which we assume is caused by the collisional fragmentation of dust grains in the upper layers of the disk. For planetesimals in the solar nebula, we show that the fragmentation velocity is too high to produce the observed radial distribution of small bodies in the outer layers. However, we also show that particles propagating inward from the disk can cause fragmentation to be too fast, and therefore the radial distribution of planetesimals is not fully determined.\nWe present a model for the thermal evolution of a protoplanetary disk with a self-gravitating accretion disk. We focus on gas accretion onto the central object in the disk, which is the main source of opacity and opacity gradients in the disk. We consider the effect of a self-gravitating disk and its angular momentum loss on the disk surface density profile, and on the disk thermal structure. In addition, we calculate the size and composition distribution of dust grains in the disk. We also present a new model for the accretion of solids from the disk into the disk interior. We find that the disk thermal structure is not a direct function of the initial mass distribution of solids within the disk, but is rather an expression of the disk surface density profile. The disk size is determined largely by the initial distribution of solids within the disk. The accretion rate increases with the initial mass distribution of solids, but the initial disk surface density profile is still a function of the initial mass distribution of solids. When the mass distribution of solids is thin, the disk thermal structure is quite similar to the previous model. The disk size is rather insensitive to the initial mass distribution of solids, but the mass distribution of solids can have an important effect. For small initial disk masses, the disk thermal structure is not entirely determined by the initial mass distribution of solids, but can be affected by the initial mass distribution of solids.\nWe present a new model for the thermal evolution of a protoplanetary disk with a self-gravitating accretion disk"}, {"Input": "The formation of photochemical hazes creates", "Output": "The formation of photochemical hazes creates a dust enhancement of the gas phase, and our work suggests that this effect may play a role in the formation of terrestrial planets, especially solid planets like those that formed via planetesimal formation.\nWe analyze the structure and evolution of protoplanetary disks with a parametrised two-dimensional (r 2) gas-disk model. The gas-disk model is used to follow the evolution of dust grains embedded in the disk during the first million years of evolution of a disk. We also investigate the dynamics of dust particles in the disk using the two-dimensional (r 2) gas-disk model in a three-dimensional (a 2D) plane. We find that the evolution of the dust grains is dependent on the initial mass of the gas disk and on the temperature of the disk. The initial mass of the gas disk is determined by the mass of the initial disk gas disk in the three-dimensional plane. The initial mass of the gas disk is then determined by fitting the r 2 gas disk model directly to the two-dimensional (r 2) plane. The gas disk evolves a mixture of radial and azimuthal grains that depends on the temperature of the disk. When the gas disk has a high initial mass, the radial grains grow rapidly, and the azimuthal grains slow down. The radial grains are scattered to the right by the radial pressure gradient and grow faster than the azimuthal grains. The radial pressure gradient in the disk causes the radial pressure gradient to the right to gradually decrease to the right in the disk, and the disk is considered stable when the gas disk has a low initial mass and low initial surface density. When the gas disk has a low initial mass and low initial surface density, the radial pressure gradient is different. When the disk is fully cooled, the gas disk evolves a mixture of radial and azimuthal grains of different sizes. When the gas disk is fully cooled, the radial grains are saturated in the disk, and the azimuthal grains become agitated. In addition, we find that the radial pressure gradient in the"}, {"Input": "The formation of photochemical hazes creates", "Output": "The formation of photochemical hazes creates a magnetic field in the gas phase that oscillates with a period of up to about 5 s.

The central object in this system is a Neptune-mass planet orbiting a M2-dwarf star with a semimajor axis of 0.88 AU. We studied the HR8799 and HD 149026 planetary systems by means of mid-infrared spectroscopy with the InfraRed Array Camera on board the Hubble Space Telescope. For H2O, we detected the emission at 2.4 and 3.3 \u03bcm, while for CO2 and CH4 we detected the absorption at 2.1, 3.5, 3.8, and 6.3 \u03bcm. For CO, we detected the emission at 4.3 \u03bcm. We also compared the spectra with photochemical models. We found that the HR8799 planetary atmosphere is dominated by CO, which absorbs 0.23% of the star's incident stellar light. We also found that the spectral lines of H2O and CO2 are well matched with the photochemical models. However, the H2O absorption bands of HR8799 b are not well matched with the photochemical models. The comparison with synthetic spectra indicated that the light of HR8799 b is mainly emitted at 3.6 \u03bcm. The finding that the CO abundance is higher than that of HD 149026b indicates that the planet has a different photochemical environment from that of HD 149026b.\nWe report the discovery of a planet of about 0.03 MJup orbiting the slightly evolved (about 1.5 Myr) solar"}, {"Input": "As we begin to discover rocky planets in the habitable zone", "Output": "As we begin to discover rocky planets in the habitable zone, we are approached by the question of how they form. This is a difficult problem because the process of migration results in the formation of a number of different orbits in the system. It is not possible to predict the orbits of planets formed in this way because the disk of planetesimals is not a simple disk and so we cannot include the effects of gas drag in the calculation. Here we use an N-body simulation of gas drag to study the orbital evolution of a system of two planets formed in the disk. We find that the migration proceeds through several different regimes: (a) in the regime where the gas drags the planetesimals along the disk, (b) in which the planetesimals are dragged inward by the gas and (c) in which the gas drags the planetesimals outward by their parent disk. The migration results in different initial orbital configurations. In the migration regime (a), the initial orbital configuration can be described by a radial distribution of the planetesimals having a range of a few tens of aus. In the migration regime (b), the initial orbital configuration can be described by a power law with index -0.4 with a dispersion of a few percent. In the third regime (c), the final orbital configuration can be described by a quadratic function with a dispersion of about 1%. We discuss the implications of these results for the formation of planetary systems in the habitable zone.

In this work, we investigate the relation between the number of discovered extrasolar planets and the fraction of Sun-like stars hosting planets. We first consider the known distribution of extrasolar planets in the mass-radius plane, and then we apply the inverse problem to calculate the number of extrasolar planets and the fraction of Sun-like stars hosting them. We then calculate the fraction of Sun-like stars hosting planets and their mass-radius relation. We show that the mass-radius relation is a powerful tool for selecting targets for extrasolar planet follow-up observations. Finally, we calculate the fraction of stars hosting an extrasolar planet in the context of the observational sample presented in the paper.\nThe study of extrasolar planets is one of the main themes of the next generation of space telescopes and of the PLATO (Polytropic Observatory Large) mission, which will be launched in 2026.

In this work, we present a new code for the estimation of the stellar wind mass-loss rates. Our code (STELLA) uses existing spectral retrieval frameworks (spectral synthesis, spectral fitting) to model the stellar wind and allows us to incorporate the impact of gravity darkening, resulting in a uniform model of the planetary atmosphere and an increased accuracy.

This is the first time that the physical parameters of the object, such as its effective temperature, have been derived from its pulsation spectrum. We obtained the spectroscopic parameters of the binary star using two different spectrographs with different pulsation modes with levels of noise. In addition, we also performed a detailed analysis of the pulsation spectrum using three different methods, finding that the analysis of the pulsation spectrum can provide many additional constraints on the physical parameters of the primary. The light curves for the three methods are in good agreement, with the secondary pulsation frequency and period determined accurately. The results for the physical parameters of the binary star are consistent with those obtained from the analysis of the pulsation spectrum.\nWe study the formation of planetary systems in discs that are stable to radial drift in the absence of gas drag. We consider the radial drift of gas in discs with a Keplerian surface density profile, which results in a stable disc structure for a wide range of logarithmic disc masses. Disc masses are determined from the stellar properties (effective temperature, surface density) and from the radial drift velocity of gas. We derive a simple criterion that yields the minimum amount of gas drag required to form a stable planetary system in discs with a wide range of stellar properties, which is then applied to the case of the solar system. We include a description of the evolution of the solar system, considering a wide range of mass ratios, disc masses, and disc timescales. We find that a disc can be stable to radial drift in a few stellar masses for 1\u00d7 10-3 to 10-2. We show that gas drag can lead to the formation of planetary systems with masses close to the minimum mass of the disc, which can result in a very rapid decay of the disc gas in a short period of time.\nWe present a detailed study of the spin and orbital properties of the short-period double-lined eclips"}, {"Input": "Earth-analogues around nearby stars", "Output": "Earth-analogues around nearby stars observed with the Spitzer Space Telescope.\nWe present a catalog of planet candidates in the Kepler field from the June 2008 to present.

We consider candidates from four different surveys: our own, the Keck, IRAS, and WISE, and from the literature. We categorize candidates by the use of the spectral resolution from the K2 mission, the magnitude of the radial velocity (RV), and the orbital period. We also search for new candidates from the literature with proper motions in the Kepler field. We find 116 new candidates with detected velocity semi-amplitudes in the K2 field of view and find 12 new candidates with RV semi-amplitudes in excess of 20 km s-1. We also find two new candidates with RV semi-amplitudes that are too large to be consistent with any known planetary body.\nThe NASA K2 mission has discovered a wealth of planetary systems, including a number of multi-planet systems that will be useful in the context of studying planetary systems. The K2 mission is targeting systems with transiting planets, and it has found transiting planets in 45 of these targets. The K2 targets are selected based on their transit probability, the magnitude of the stellar flux, and the transit duration. We present a catalog of all observed planetary systems with transiting planets in the K2 field, and the results of the K2 mission. The K2 targets are selected from the K2 targets of interest, and the catalog is completed by combining all available transit-like data with the K2 light curves.

The Kepler mission has provided a wealth of statistics on the occurrence of planetary systems. However, the completeness varies depending on the target properties. Aims: We aim to understand the dependence of the completeness on the target properties and study the dependence of the completeness on the target properties, in particular on the mass of the host star. Methods: Using our previously developed code, we computed the completeness of the Kepler target sample, and we compared the completeness with the completeness for different target properties. We also derived the dependence of the completeness on the mass of the host star. Results: We find that the mass is somewhat of an important factor, since the mass can affect the completeness of the target sample. We find that the mass dependence of the mass dependence of the completeness is quite broad, but that it is not always statistically significant. The mass dependence of the mass dependence of the completeness is not only significant for different target properties, but it is also statistically significant for all target properties. Conclusions: With the help of the massive target data, the mass dependence of the completeness can be determined from the mass. The mass dependence of the completeness can therefore be investigated using the full completeness of the Kepler target sample.\nWe report the discovery of K2-145b, a warm Jupiter orbiting a bright (V = 8.5 mag) G-type subgiant with an orbital period of 11.224 days and a semi-major axis of 0.576 AU.

We also estimate the frequency of planets that form and survive in such a system. We consider the orbital properties and structure of the inner and outer disks of the disk, and the impact of planet formation on the structure of the inner disks. We then compare the results to numerical simulations to determine the occurrence rate of planets around solar-like stars. We find that about half of the simulations predict at least one planet within 10 AU of the star, while two-thirds predict at least one planet in the 10-100 AU radius range. We find that the inner disk of the disk is not a dense, non-spherical disk but rather has a radial surface density profile that is consistent with a spherical fit. We also find that the disk disk is not a disk with a sharp radius at all radii. We also find that the planet formation rate is lower than predicted by the simulation because the simulation begins with a low-mass planet close to the star and then moves to a more massive planet in the outer disk.\nWe present and report on the discovery of a new transiting K2V-type binary, K2-268.

The same effect is expected to occur when the planet passes in front of and behind the star. Those two effects can form planets with orbital periods of a few days, or a few months, that are too close to the star for tidal circularization of the orbital circularization timescale. We examine the orbital decay due to planetary orbits and show that the dynamical evolution of a close-in planet can cause it to move in a slightly eccentric orbit. We also find that the orbital decay due to the presence of a hypothetical second planet, caused by a planet in the system, can cause it to become lost to tidal circularization by an order of magnitude. We conclude that the formation of planets with orbital periods much shorter than the Roche period can be supported by a reasonable probability distribution over the mass ratio.\nWe present the results of the analysis of the distribution of masses, periods, and eccentricities for Kepler planets that are likely to be observed in the coming years. We first present the results of the analysis of the Kepler Objects of Interest (KOIs) with masses and periods that are too long for their orbits to be well-aligned to the orbits of known planets. We then model the distribution of masses, periods, and eccentricities for known planets and compare it to the distribution of masses for the Kepler planets. We find that the distribution of masses is strongly biased toward low masses and that the period distribution is well-aligned to the orbits of known planets, but the bias is not perfect. The eccentricity distribution can be well approximated by a power-law with index 0.35 for planets with periods less than 10 days. The mass distribution of the known planets fits well to the mass distribution of low-mass planets with periods less than 10 days.

We find that the stellar surface convection and magnetic activity are strongly coupled over the entire magnetic activity cycle. The overall activity level depends sensitively on the time-scale of convection and magnetic activity. For a given stellar activity level, we find that the activity evolution and magnetic activity evolution are strongly coupled. In particular, the magnetic activity cycle is faster for active stars, with a stronger peak in the activity near the beginning of the cycle, followed by a slower decline as the activity decreases. In contrast, we find that the stellar magnetic field is not intrinsically slow during the full cycle. We also find that the magnetic activity is not a proxy for the stellar rotation. The mean activity level and magnetic activity cycle of the star AD Leo are in good agreement. However, we find that the stellar rotation is not a proxy for the stellar mass, age, and rotation period.

We present a new approach to spectroscopy, which we call the photometric pseudo-imaging technique. The spatial profile of the line profile shapes and the intensity ratios are adjusted to obtain a good match with the spectra. The spectra are then analyzed with a photometric technique that uses the physical properties of the star and the planet to determine the corrected stellar and planetary spectra. We present an implementation of this technique that allows for spectroscopic data to be visually analyzed. We demonstrate the capability of this technique by applying it to the hot-Jupiter WASP-12b. This allows us to obtain a 3\u03c3 upper limit of the planet-to-star radius ratio of 0.195 for the planet's effective size in the visible band. In the near-infrared, we derive a lower limit of 0.174 for the planet's radiative properties. We also apply the technique to WASP-12b's planetary atmosphere.

It involves a simple mathematical description of the processes of light absorption, including the treatment of the absorption due to dust grains. The main advantage of the AGPM is its ability to describe the physical processes at play, enabling it to be used in virtually any astrophysical problem involving the absorption of light by dust grains. Here, we present the results of our verification of the AGPM performance during the first light test of the instrument during its commissioning.\nRecent results indicate that the atmosphere of Jupiter is moving toward a warmer temperature and that the cloud cover is increasing. This suggests that cloud cover is a natural consequence of the dynamical evolution of the atmosphere. We show that the velocity of the winds is determined by the size and shape of the thermal emission features in the atmosphere. We calculate the velocity of the winds from the star-planet system with an experienced observer, and find that the winds are generally a few times the system velocity and typically \u223c10 times the Jupiter equator. The star-planet system is not an isolated object. The winds are found to flow over the entire planet and down into the atmosphere. The atmospheric circulation is generally carried by the superior and inferior torques. We find that the inferior torques are dominated by the superior torques; the inferior torques are dominated by the inferior torques.

Because the best models can only be used for a small range of molecular data, the model is limited to a small area of the atmosphere. The model is also limited because the physical properties of the planet are not parameterized.

We find that all the scenario fits are compatible with the observed spectrum, but that the H2O and CO2 abundances are strongly dependent on the orbital distance of the planet. We find that the solar abundance of H2O is not sufficient for the planet to retain its pre-transit H2O absorption, but that it is sufficient for the planet to be devoid of H2O at the transition between H2O and CO2. We also find that the planet's atmospheric composition and H2O abundances are strongly controlled by its orbital distance, and that the planet was likely formed with a high-pressure atmosphere or not.\nDuring the epoch of planet formation, the protoplanetary disks (PPDs) contained pebbles that were subject to a dominant contribution from planetesimals during their growth (the \"pebble cascade\").

This is because the planet's spectral energy distribution follows a double law. The first law is that the planet's luminosity is proportional to its geometric albedo. The second law is that the planet's geometric albedo is the same as the geometric albedo of the disk, and is therefore directly proportional to the planet's geometric albedo. We present a new technique for the characterization of the geometric albedo of a planet, which enables an unfeasible physical distance to be measured.

In this paper, we apply this technique to the case of HAT-P-4b. We present light curves of the planet as it would appear to an observer at various orbital phases, from its periastron to the apoastron. We also derive an orbital inclination and an atmospheric transmission spectrum of the planet. Using the recent HST/NICMOS data, we generate a transit light curve of the planet and determine the orbital inclination and atmospheric transmission spectrum from which we then derive the planetary radius and mass. We find that HAT-P-4b is a very compact example of a planet with a compact atmosphere and a compact radius. The planet mass is 6.5 \u00b1 1.5 M\u2295, and the equilibrium temperature is expected to be around 2000 K.\nWe report on a measurement of the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect for a faint transiting planet candidate discovered by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite. The planet, KOI-13, was discovered during Campaign 14 of the TESS mission. The TESS light curve of KOI-13b is not fully sampled and thus does not fully constrain the planet's geometry. We analyze the TESS light curve to determine the projected spin-orbit angle \u03bb, the physical and orbital parameters of the system, and the system's stellar parameters. We find that the planet's orbit is well constrained, with a projected spin-orbit angle of \u03bb = -39.\u00b07 \u00b1 3.\u00b03. We find a period of 11.7992\u00b1 0.00001 days and a planet mass of 0.3\u00b1 0.07 MJup. The three other parameters of interest are not well constrained. We find that the planet's transit is likely to be shallow, with a transit depth of 0.082%\u00b10.010%. The planet's radius is best fit at 1.2\u03c3.

The transit depth of 0.0057 \u00b1 0.0014 mmag, corresponding to a planetary radius of Rp = 1.6 \u00b1 0.4 RJ, is among the deepest for any exoplanet. We determined the stellar brightness and, more importantly, the planet's planetary radius and orbital inclination. We obtained the following orbital parameters: n = (9.70 \u00b1 0.41) \u00b1 (0.26 \u00b1 0.10) \u00b1 (0.10 \u00b1 0.02) and q = (2.7 \u00b1 0.3) \u00b1 (0.04 \u00b1 0.05) \u00b1 (0.08 \u00b1 0.03). The time of the transit corresponds to a homogeneous period of 1.6 days and an orbital inclination \u03bb = (12 \u00b1 1)\u00b0. We derive an improved system parameters (Porb = 2.787326 \u00b1 0.00001, Qtr = 2.86719 \u00b1 0.00038, and efp = (0.05 \u00b1 0.06)\u00d710-4.

We refine the orbital ephemeris, which was previously reported using the WASP-South network. We use this new light curve to test the presence of any variability in the transit timing and to check for variations in the transit duration induced by possible planets. We find that there is no evidence for any such variations. We also combine these results with published radial velocity (RV) measurements, as well as existing transit light curve information, to search for evidence of transit timing variations. We find no evidence of such variations, but we do find evidence for transit duration variations, which are suggestive of a planet with a period ratio close to 1. We use this results to place constraints on the planetary mass and orbital inclination. We find that WASP-2b is most likely a Neptune-mass planet with a period ratio close to 0.55 and an orbital inclination of about 45\u00b0, which is consistent with the values of WASP-South and TESS for the original WASP-South network, while the new TESS data place the new upper limit of 4 M\u2295 and 70-150 M\u2295 on the planet's eccentricity. The latter values are consistent with a circular orbit for the planet around a Sun-like star. We also discuss the possible presence of a second planet in the system, which is expected to have a lower mass and a larger orbit.\nWe report the discovery of a transiting hot Jupiter from the WASP transit survey.

We compare our results to previous studies and emphasize the need for improved theoretical models for temperature-pressure profiles over the range of effective temperatures and abundances typically used in the literature. We conclude that a combination of spectroscopic and photometric measurements is required to determine the composition and temperature of planets.\nWe present a detailed analysis of the long-period medium-duration photometric variability of the Be/X-ray binary SXP 1033-2544, which was recently discovered to exhibit variable emission during X-ray outbursts. Our analysis includes the presence of two more new outbursts, as well as independent evidence for the existence of additional outbursts. Combining all available observations with the literature, we find that the period of the first new outburst is \u223c3 yr, and that the second one is \u223c7 yr. We demonstrate that the magnetic field of the Be/X-ray binary is not the only cause of the observed variability. We also find an independent correlation between the mass function of the Be/X-ray binary and its spheroidal magnetic field.\nWe present the results of a deep analysis of the Be/X-ray binary SXP 1033-2544 obtained with the XMM-Newton and Chandra satellite observatories during the 2007-2008 Be/X-ray binary (BeXRB) outburst. We detect a large amount of asymmetry and thermal emission of the neutron star in the BeXRB using a combination of XMM-Newton and Chandra data. We derive the orbital parameters of the Be/X-ray binary from the orbital analysis of the Chandra data and its orbital solution, which is in good agreement with the orbital parameters obtained from the BeXRB observations. The BeXRB is found to be a pulsating neutron star system with a second-lowest mass primary, a period of \u223c71 d, and an angular diameter of \u223c40 arcsec"}, {"Input": "We can remotely sense an atmosphere by observing its reflected, transmitted, or emitted light in varying geometries.

Our observations were obtained during the first five nights of the planet's science mission, which ended at 2:07 UT on 2013 May 3. We combine them with archival Keck/HIRES data to produce a total of 19 transit light curves, 27 with periods of less than 3 hr and 14 with periods of more than 3 months. We further combine the HIRES light curves with the newly found light curves from the HATNet survey to produce the full dataset. Our new light curves are consistent with previously published transit depths and thus rule out planets that are either larger than expected or have significant periods. We find a transit probability of 55%. We combine our transit time with the orbital parameters determined in previous work to calculate an updated ephemeris for the host star. The new planetary system is a tight 1:1 resonance with a period of 2069 \u00b1 12 days. We observe evidence of a significant precession of the planet's orbit with a period of 870 \u00b1 4 days. A slight precession of the stellar spin axis is also seen in the stellar radial velocities, but we cannot detect it in the transit light curves due to a degeneracy with the stellar rotation. We also report a transit failure at the 2:07 UT, which is consistent with the predicted occultation due to a stellar companion with a minimum mass of Msin i=0.045+0.014-0.012 M\u2609 .\nWe present the first results from the Penn State - Toru\u0144 Centre"}, {"Input": "We can remotely sense an atmosphere by observing its reflected, transmitted, or emitted light in varying geometries.

Here, we present a novel method that can be applied to transit and eclipse observations of Earth-like exoplanets. We combine spectroscopic and photometric light curves to create a light curve template of the planet, which is then used in combination with a light curve model to predict the planetary spectral and brightness properties, including the absence of a day side. We then apply the method to ground-based spectroscopy of the hot Jupiter HAT-P-0b, which shows an almost-zero atmospheric albedo, complete darkness at short wavelengths, and a very large day side, extending to roughly 85% of the planet's radius. We show that the planet\u2019s spectral and brightness properties are well matched by this template. Our results for HAT-P-0b imply that the planet\u2019s day side will be brighter and will be slightly shallower than the night side.\nAims: We present an analysis of new transit observations of the hot-Jupiter WASP-12b obtained with the HARPS instrument on the 3.6 m telescope at La Silla Observatory, ESO Chile.

The thermal emission of a planet is determined by the planet's orbit. If a planet orbits close to its parent star, the planet's orbit can be very close to the moon's orbit.

This emission depends on the planet's orbit. Planets that rotate fast and are close to their host stars will have the largest peak in thermal emission. Planets orbiting slower rotators will have a smaller peak in emission.\nWe study the orbital evolution of extrasolar moons under the effect of their tidal circularization. The moon is assumed to be in a close circular orbit around the planet. The general condition for moon to planet tidal circularization is that the moon's orbit and planet's orbit are nearly aligned. The moon's orbit is assumed to be aligned with the planet's orbit if the moon's orbit is sufficiently close to the planet's orbit. We generalize this condition to any satellite. We show that moons that are close to their central stars may undergo tidal circularization if their orbits are sufficiently close to their orbits and/or their orbits are not eccentric.

Instead, the distributions of planetary parameters derived from the difference in the relative flux at different wavelengths are used to determine planetary radii. We then compare these radii to predictions from models to constrain the planetary composition, and find that planets orbiting a low-mass M-dwarf host or an M-dwarf host orbiting a high-mass G-dwarf host are unlikely to exhibit a significant radial temperature difference to the observed radii.

It was detected from Doppler tomographic observations carried out with the ELODIE and the CORALIE spectrographs, and the radial velocities were derived from the multi-band light curves.

We use the LSST to study the stellar activity in M dwarfs over the full orbital period, exploring the dependence of the stellar activity on the orbital period and the rotation period. We also study the effect of the rotation period on the stellar activity. We find that for fast rotators the activity also has a strong effect on the stellar properties. In particular, the lower the rotation period the more the activity depends on the orbital period. The activity also slightly decreases for the hot stars, which are more active than the coolest stars. On the other hand, the activity does not decrease for the coolest stars. We also investigate the effect of the stellar activity on planetary transit light curves, and we find that for more active stars the transit light curves are slightly distorted.\nContext.

Here we present the results of hydrodynamical simulations of the evolution of the mass-radius relationship for M-dwarfs that include the effects of hydrogen envelopes. We use the MESA code to model the evolution of the mass-radius relation for M-dwarfs that are initially rocky with a mass fraction of 0.1. The initial mass fraction for the system is varied from 0% to 100%. We find that the initial mass fraction is not fixed but may be dynamically dependent on the initial radius. We then simulate the evolution of the mass-radius relation for planets with different initial masses and varying initial envelopes. We find that planetary cores grow through collisions and accrete gas and solid cores through accretion. The size distribution of runaway planets is consistent with that of the observed distribution of planets. However, the cores are not sufficiently massive to form gas-giant planets.

We derive an analytical formula to predict the spectra of a planet's transmission spectrum with a wide range of values of the radius, density, and bulk composition of the atmosphere. We then use this to predict the spectra of the expected planets, and for each case, we calculate the expected errors in the planets' radii. We then compare our results to predictions from the HITRAN database, the Kepler mission, and the radial velocity (RV) surveys, and we find that many planets will be biased towards small radii, and therefore the products of the models will be biased towards lower radii than expected. This means that for each planet, we should expect a relative error in the radii to be at most a few per cent. This is only possible because hot Jupiters are expected to be observed in high-resolution, and thus the planets' radii are predicted to be small relative to that of the host star. We also find that the intensity of the planetary signal will be strongly determined by the atmosphere.

We show that a single method can be used to model the atmospheres of extrasolar planets with a uniform cloud deck, and with a uniform diffusion coefficient for the stellar wind. We simulate the close-in extrasolar planetary atmospheres with the Particle Physics Simulator to study the effect of the atmosphere and the planetary gravity on the structure and evolution of the atmosphere.

We find that our forward-modelling code can predict exactly the structure and chemical composition of exoplanetary atmospheres, and thus constrain the core mass and an accurate exoplanet atmospheric composition. We focus on the atmospheric chemistry of Jupiter and Saturn, and are able to constrain their composition using the model obtained from the forward-modelled code. We find that both planets are able to obtain a moderate amount of water (\u223c1.5 molar), but a smaller amount (\u223c1.7 molar) is needed for the atmosphere of Saturn. With the inclusion of the Saturnian conditions, this amount of water is consistent with the theoretical predictions of the model. The results of our code demonstrate that using forward modelling, rather than direct numerical integration, can provide a more direct and accurate estimate of the chemical composition and surface gravity of exoplanets.\nWe present a detailed analysis of the Kepler light curve of the transiting extrasolar planet XO-3b, which was initially identified as a candidate from the Kepler mission. We derive novel constraints on the planetary properties by matching the data to a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMCMC) fitting procedure and to the spectral energy distribution (SED) from the literature. We find that the SED modifies the shape of the transit light curve, which is sensitive to the obliquity of the planetary orbit. We observe that the transit duration is a key parameter in determining the obliquity, and that the planetary radius is underestimated by about 45\u00b0. We constrain the planet's orbit inclination to \u220a = 0.29^+0.18_-0.12 deg, which is consistent with a zero inclination"}, {"Input": "Exoplanet atmospheric models capable of interpreting the upcoming observations are often limited by insufficiencies in the laboratory and theoretical data that", "Output": "Exoplanet atmospheric models capable of interpreting the upcoming observations are often limited by insufficiencies in the laboratory and theoretical data that can be derived from observations. Therefore, an accurate calculation of atmospheric properties is necessary. We present an analytical model for the atmospheric structure of a habitable region around a star to be observed with the Habitable-zone Planet Finder (HPF) instrument on the 3.5-m United Kingdom Infrared Telescope (UKIRT) and the InfraRed Array Camera (IRAC) on the 8-m United States Infrared Telescope (USIR). The model is constructed to represent an Earth-like atmosphere with a zero-pressure Earth-like atmosphere, and is made for the case of a planet that is not fully convective. We show that the HPF data and the IRAC data can be described by a single pressure-pressure formulation for the case with a low insolation. The model was calculated for the case with the planet at 2 AU and the planet at 30 AU. The planet mass and radius are set to 1.7 and 1.7, respectively. The results for the mass and radius of the planet are 0.83 and 0.50 RJ, respectively. The model also predicts stellar irradiation for that star. We also show that the Earth-like atmosphere is likely to be significantly denser in the more massive planet, and that the upper atmosphere of the planet will be significantly denser as well.\nThe Hydrogen isotopic composition of the Atmosphere of Titan (H2O) is an important input to various studies of the early solar system. We present a new time-dependent re-analysis of H2O measurements for the solar system, covering the years 1980-1993, obtained with the High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer on the IRAC Telescope at the European Southern Observatory (ESO) 1.2m telescope. We have calculated new re-analysis tables for H2O line mixing with respect to the solar ionization state, which were most recently updated by Lissauer et al. (2004). We find that the solar ionization state affects the measured H2O abundance by a factor of about three, with the largest effects"}, {"Input": "Exoplanet atmospheric models capable of interpreting the upcoming observations are often limited by insufficiencies in the laboratory and theoretical data that", "Output": "Exoplanet atmospheric models capable of interpreting the upcoming observations are often limited by insufficiencies in the laboratory and theoretical data that are not available in situ. We derive a new approach to model cell-based atmospheric models that is based on the assumption that the chemistry and radiative transfer in the atmosphere plays a critical role in determining the spectrum, spectral feature, and cloud properties. We show that the chemistry in the atmosphere determines the spectra, the models are described by the spectral retrievals, and the cloud properties are constrained by the retrievals. We apply our technique to the current generation of retrievals of exoplanet atmospheres and obtain that it is possible to constrain cloud properties with retrievals. We apply our technique to the atmospheres of the hot-Jupiter exoplanets WASP-12b and WASP-19b and find that it is possible to constrain the cloud properties in the atmospheres of these two planets.\nWe present a new radial velocity (RV) survey for transiting extrasolar planets. The survey targets stars with previous detections in the literature. We use archival data from the WASP survey and the HARPS spectrograph to search for transiting extrasolar planets. We report the discovery of two new transiting extrasolar planets: WASP-1b and WASP-2b. WASP-1b is a rocky planet with a period of 4.0 days, a mass of 0.19 M_J, and a radius of 0.46 R_J, which orbits the slightly evolved G5V star HD 7068 (V = 8.4mag). WASP-2b has a period of 5.8 days, a mass of 0.03 M_J, and a radius of 0.08 R_J. The planet has a mass of 0.32 M_J and a radius of 0.28 R_J. We analyze the radii and masses of the two transiting planets, finding that WASP-1b and WASP-2b have large overlap. The mass of WASP-1b is likely to be larger than 3.6 MJup, while"}, {"Input": "Exoplanet atmospheric models capable of interpreting the upcoming observations are often limited by insufficiencies in the laboratory and theoretical data that", "Output": "Exoplanet atmospheric models capable of interpreting the upcoming observations are often limited by insufficiencies in the laboratory and theoretical data that are not always available from observations.

We find that the metallicity of the atmosphere can be determined unambiguously from the H\u03b1 line.\nWe present the first results of a high-contrast imaging survey using the NACO instrument at the Palomar 4 m telescope. The survey targets nearby young stars and extends to a distance of \u03bb \u2248 100 pc. With NACO we are able to reach contrast levels of up to \u2206 \\mathrmspr104 at 2'' resolution. We have also used the NACO adaptive optics system to correct for the effects of the Earth's atmosphere on the light curves. With the NACO instrument, we achieve an improved sensitivity to point sources at the distance of the survey. This sensitivity allows us to find and remove stellar points-like sources. We have found that the companion stars to several of the target stars in our survey are of spectral type B-M. The companion stars to two of the companion stars also host planets.

We investigate the effects of a variety of atmospheric models including a simple two-temperature template, a two-temperature template, and a two-temperature template. We find that the two-temperature template has the largest effect on the atmospheric structure. We find that the two-temperature template is most significant for a wide range of global surface properties, at all latitudes, which makes it a useful tool for investigating the atmospheric composition and thermal structure of exoplanets. The two-temperature template has little effect on small surface gradients and radiative effects in the planet atmosphere.\nAims: We investigate the formation of giant planets from planetesimal disks in the presence of gravitational instabilities (GIs) in the disk. Methods: Direct imaging of disks with protoplanetary cores is used to detect GIs and, in particular, detect disk-to-star flux ratios. Results: We present the results of direct imaging of four disks around young stars: HD 181388, HD 110780, HD 123744, and HD 185269. We did not detect any disk-to-star flux ratio in the four disks around young stars. We performed spectral energy distribution fitting with the MARCS radiative transfer code and we detected 10 low-amplitude spiral modes in HD 110780. We detected two modes that we interpret as low-order radial modes. We detected disk-to-star flux ratios of 0.098 \u00b1 0.014 and 0.1110 \u00b1 0.0048 in HD 181388 and HD 185269, respectively. Conclusions: Our results suggest that the disk masses in the disk-forming region are not limited by mass in the form of a power law. We suggest that a configuration in which the disk-forming region is located at the inner edge of the disk, and its size is determined by the disk's radius, is more consistent with the disk mass in the disk-forming region being limited by the mass in the disk.

This book provides a detailed description of a collection of methods for estimating atmospheric models, solving for the temperature, pressure, and gravity, and comparing models to observations. The book includes the following features: a description of the statistical properties of atmospheric models, derivation of the physical properties of models, and validation of atmospheric models. The book covers a wide range of atmospheric parameter space, from the atmosphere of Venus to the atmospheres of Jupiter and Saturn, which provides a wealth of information for studying the atmospheric structure and dynamics of exoplanets with ground-based and spaceborne observations.\nWe report the detection of a brown dwarf companion to the nearby (about 30 pc), young (about 10-6000 years) M5.5V star LP 729-18 (WISE J031415.93-592205.9), which was previously identified through photometric and spectroscopic follow-up. The companion is a candidate member of the about 10 Myr K2 subgroup of the about 10 Myr M0V star LP 729-18. The companion has a minimum mass of m2 sin i = 14 M Jup and is located at a projected separation of about 15 AU. LP 729-18 is a metal-poor star with a metallicity [Fe/H] = -0.19 \u00b1 0.09, an effective temperature of T eff = 6300 \u00b1 100 K, and a luminosity of log L/ Lsolar = -3.2 \u00b1 0.2. Its main sequence (MS) companion, LP 729-18 B, has a minimum mass of m2 sin i = 14 M Jup and a separation of about 15 AU. The separation of the MS companion is significantly smaller than that of the MS companion to the nearby (about 10 pc) young (about 10 Myr) solar analog LP 729-18, which is a 2 Myr old and active star.

We study the effects of aerosols on the composition of the cold outer atmospheres of warm-gas giants. We focus on the condensation of condensates produced during atmospheric escape from the planet. We consider the effects of the condensation of aerosols as the primary means of producing momentum for the observed global escape rate, in particular, the effects of a decrease in the escape velocity due to the condensation of aerosols. The cold outer atmospheres of warm-gas giants show a greater variation in composition than the warm atmospheres of ice giants, which indicates that the cold atmospheres of warm-gas giants are more susceptible to condensation. The presence of aerosols in the atmospheres of some of the giant planets is inferred from the observed properties of the spectral lines. We find that the temperatures of the early atmospheres of some giant planets are considerably higher than those observed in the late atmospheres of icy giant planets. This suggests that the early atmospheres of ice giants could be considerably warmer than their late counterparts.\nAn important goal of exoplanetary science is to detect and characterize exoplanets. This can be achieved by measuring the mass and radius of exoplanets. We present a statistical analysis of the mass and radius distributions of exoplanets, which are used to infer the mass and radius distributions of the stars that host exoplanets. We focus on the Sun, which hosts nine exoplanets. The analysis shows that the mass distribution of exoplanets is a power law: it accounts for the mass increase due to gas accretion and the radius decrease due to stellar evolution. The mass distribution of stars hosting exoplanets is not as straight as one might expect from scaling relations. The mass increase due to gas accretion is in contradiction of the predictions of stellar evolution models. This implies that the stars hosting exoplanets are old, which is consistent with observations. We also find that the radius distribution accounts for the mass increase due to stellar evolution, which is larger than predicted by stellar evolution models.\nWe"}, {"Input": "Photochemical organic aerosols are ubiquitous in the cold outer Solar System where", "Output": "Photochemical organic aerosols are ubiquitous in the cold outer Solar System where condensible aerosols have been detected. We present GCM simulations of atmospheric dynamics with two general-purpose atmospheric models: the Rayleigh-Lambert (RL) and the Heidberger (HEL) atmospheric models. We find that the HEL simulation reproduces the observed solar UV flux with a lower degree of freedom. We find a changing planetary albedo, which controls the extent of the planetary albedo, as a function of the total solar irradiance. We also find that the solar XUV flux is not a sufficient proxy for the total solar irradiance distribution; however, it is an important proxy for the HZ of the planet. We also find that the planetary albedo is likely to be substantially larger than the intrinsic stellar albedo. Our results indicate that the amount of the planetary albedo is likely to be larger than the total solar irradiance, especially in regions where the stellar XUV flux influences the planetary albedo.\nContext. It is well known that ephemerides for transiting extrasolar planets depend on the quality of photometry. However, how well known is the quality of the photometric data? Aims: We search the data from the Kepler mission for transit signals and then perform a detailed investigation of the transit events. Methods: We analyzed the photometric data with the software package PERIOD04 and also performed simultaneous fits to the radial velocity and the light curves using the software package LIME, which is available for download. Results: We show that the photometric data are well characterized by a two-parameter relation, showing a power-law-type curve. However, the second power-law-type curve does not reveal any departures from a Gaussian distribution with a dashed edge in the interval [-1.5, 2.5] .

Our model treats condensation and condensation best suited to the atmospheres of Jupiter and Saturn, where the chemical effects arising from condensation and condensation's dependence on the ambient temperature and pressure are taken into account in our calculations. We find the abundances of CH 3C and C 2H 2 in Jupiter to be similar to those measured in Saturn and lower than those detected in the atmospheres of Saturn and Uranus, where the abundance ratios are likely to be lower. We also find the abundances of H 2O, C 2H 4, and HCN to be similar to those measured in Saturn and lower than those measured in Uranus and Uranus, where the abundances are likely to be higher. The abundance ratios of CH 3C and C 2H 2 in Jupiter and lower are similar to those measured in Uranus and lower. We also find no evidence for differences in J, H, and K abundances between the atmospheres of Jupiter and lower levels, which is inconsistent with the expectation that such differences would be evident in the observations. We also find that the chemical compositions of the atmospheres of the two giant planets are similar, and that their atmospheres are less likely to contain potential aerosol reservoirs.\nWe describe a new algorithm for the fast detection of faint transiting exoplanets from photometric transit surveys. The algorithm uses the full light curves from the photometric survey, but it searches for transit signatures in the light curves that are made more difficult by the presence of a stellar companion in the frame.

The chemical composition of the atmospheres and the optical thickness of clouds are all affected by the presence of aerosols. The structure of the atmospheres is thus one of the most important factors affecting the chemistry of the atmospheres. The chemistry of aerosols in the atmospheres of giant exoplanets is therefore of fundamental importance for their physical and chemical evolution. Here we report a detailed analysis of the chemistry of water in the atmospheres of the giant planets, and of methane in their envelopes. The gas giant planets in the Solar System exhibit a relatively narrow range of H2O abundance. We show that water is abundant in Saturn's atmosphere, and that the water abundance is enhanced by a factor of about 2 above its satellite abundance. In Uranus, water is also abundant among the envelopes of the planet. The abundance of methane is almost constant over the planet's history and is enhanced below the satellite abundance by a factor of about 2. In Neptune, the methane abundance is comparatively low, and the water abundance is enhanced by a factor of about 2 below the satellite abundance. In Saturn, the methane abundance is high, about 10 times the satellite abundance, but the water abundance is modest. The mass-loss rates in these atmospheres are complex, and our results provide further support for the importance of large-scale processes in the formation of giant exoplanets.\nThe atmospheres of extrasolar planets are often assumed to be in chemical equilibrium. However, the elemental abundances of the main components of planetary atmospheres can vary dramatically due to the presence of atmospheric turbulence, assuming that equilibrium is maintained. This is due to the strong effects of turbulence on the abundances of the main atmospheric components. Here, we study the chemical evolution of atmospheres in transiting hot Jupiter exoplanets.

In the present work, we demonstrate that gas-phase reactions of hydrocarbons to acetylene can produce the active, fissile material that can be hot enough to cause condensation in the interstellar medium, where it can be incorporated into condensate clouds. We find that the most important reaction is the thermochemical reaction of the first reaction, which may lead to the formation of hydrocarbon aerosols in the interplanetary medium. We also find that the reaction of hydrocarbons to acetylene can also yield significant amounts of fissile material in the interstellar medium.\nWe report the detection of a long-period, single-temperature binary system with a transiting hot Jupiter orbiting the active M2V star GJ 436. We present a detailed transit light curve of GJ 436b obtained with the BRITE Spectrograph on the Anglo-Australian Telescope.

This indicates that the comet's surface activity has not declined over the course of its trip to the inner Solar System.

We use the solar wind equation of state as a physical model to quantify the vertical transport of volatiles in the upper atmosphere and the solar wind equation of state to infer the velocity profiles of the photospheric and molecular cloud particles. We find that the vertical transport of volatiles must be the dominant horizontal transport mechanism in the solar wind, and that the Sun is unlikely to transport aerosols in the temperature or density range of the atmosphere. The vertical transport of aerosols is also likely to be important in the cold outer Solar System if the Sun was placed on a circular orbit with a velocity equal to that of the interstellar medium.\nWe present Hubble Space Telescope (HST) astrometry and photometry of the four transiting hot Jupiters TrES-3b, TrES-4b, TrES-5b, TrES-6b, and WASP-47b.

The model treats the gas in the particles' vicinity as a reflection nebula, which draws its ontology from the material in the comet-like bodies that have been observed in the inner Solar System. We find that the gas is small, a few micrometers in diameter, and that the dust is optically thin to the gas. The large size and small size of the particles also account for the small spectral reflectance of the grains under the conditions of the chosen scattering nebula model. As a result, DUSTY-DRIVE's spectral requirements are broad in order of magnitude.

Aerosol is often assumed to be created by volatiles that have been driven into the deep interior by gravitational settling. Here we report a new model for the evolution of aerosol and gas in the solar nebula. We show that the dynamics of the nebula can be controlled by the accumulation of large amounts of gas and dust. The gas pressure gradient inside the nebula creates a radial pressure gradient that drives the gas outwards. As the gas accumulates, it saturates along the radial pressure gradient. The surface density of the gas on the disk is not always an accurate reflection of the gas pressure gradient. In the case of rapidly rotating regions of the disk, this effect can produce a large density gradient that can be significant in the presence of radial pressure gradient. The dynamical gradient can also lead to the formation of small particles and dust grains that can persist over a large region of the disk. We also find that the evolution of aerosols can lead to the formation of larger particles in the disk that are inhomogeneous in structure, composition, and composition.\nWe present high-resolution optical spectroscopy of the low-mass X-ray binary pulsar PSR J0357+5127, which was previously identified as a new type of pulsar identified by Hamer et al.

We present chemical kinetics and chemical kinetics calculations of aerosols from the late LHB and the nebula phase, as well as for each of the three major isotopic composition groups derived from the analysis of meteorite parent bodies. We demonstrate that the chemistry of precursors in the LHB can be described by a simple chemical kinetics model including chemical reactions, chemical mixing, and chemical compression. The composition of the parent bodies formed in the LHB is not directly observable, but chemical kinetics studies can provide a means to directly infer the composition of solids in the nebula.\nAims: We aim to study the orbital properties of known transiting exoplanets and to determine the orbital configuration of the host stars.

A total of 1692 stars were observed for 12+months from 2009 to 2011, with the missions tracking their brightness and rotation.

We study the effect of spots on the light curves using light curves from the MOST archive and find that the spot latitudes vary independently of the stellar rotation period. The spot latitudes increase as the rotation period increases, and they do not depend on the stellar activity. We find that spot latitudes can be correlated with the occurrence of eclipses and tidal circularization of the orbit of a planet. However, the rate at which spots are present in the photosphere is not directly correlated with the orbital period.

We have developed a general form for the disk viscosity which we use to calculate the disk viscosity and scale of the orbital evolution. For a fixed planet mass, we have found an equilibrium distribution of the disk viscosity, which is a function of orbital distance and mass loss. We find that the disk viscosity is dominated by the tidal force. The disk mass loss rates due to the interaction between the planet and the protostar are also determined.

The mass-loss rates are varied to investigate the effect of the stellar wind mass loss on the disk accretion process. We find that the mass-loss rates from stellar winds are usually not sufficient to form Jupiter analogs, but that heavy-element enrichments can be produced at a different rate by the disk wind than by the core accretion mechanism. For example, the disk mass-loss rate can be increased by a factor of about 2 if the disk mass is more than about 0.01 Msolar.\nWe observed the M3.5V star HD 33400 in Order II Rapid Imager (RIRI) mode with the Keck I telescope, with the goal of detecting additional planets in the system.

This is due to the fact that mutual collisions between planets lead to the formation of a network of orbits that is stable against external perturbations.\nWe study the core accretion (C-E) model of gas giant planet formation. It is commonly accepted that the core accretion scenario is the dominant mechanism for gas giant planet formation. However, it is not clear whether the disk stability is maintained by the C-E mechanism or by planet-planet scattering. We investigate the stability of disks by studying their growth and decay by using a Lagrangian disk model. We also study the surface density profiles in the disk as a function of planet mass and orbital distance. We find that the stability of the disk in the region between 1 and 100 AU is not guaranteed by the C-E mechanism. The disk surface density profile in the region beyond 1 AU is also not guaranteed by the C-E mechanism. We also find that planet migration through the disk may be unstable. We also find that the disk surface density profile can be well approximated by the familiar closed-form form of the secular Hamiltonian profile.

The system was discovered using the discovery paper by Torres et al. (2014) based on the COS light curve obtained in the course of the K2 mission.

We also study the orbital evolution of relatively massive super-Earths, and find that the periastron distance has to be much larger than the semimajor axis. We then consider the formation of super-Neptunes and super-Jupiters in the range 1.0-1.5 M\u2295 and 1.0-2.1 R\u2295, respectively. We find that super-Neptunes form faster than super-Jupiters in the range of 1.0-1.5 M\u2295, and super-Jupiters form faster than super-Earths in the range of 1.1-1.0 R\u2295. We thus investigate the formation of super-Earths and super-Neptunes in the range of 1.0-2.1 R\u2295, and compare them to each other. We also investigate the occurrence of super-Jupiters and super-Earths, and determine that they are less frequent than super-Earths and super-Neptunes in the range of 2.1-1.0 R\u2295. The appearance of super-Earths in the range of 1.0-1.1 R\u2295 is also discussed.\nWe study the orbital evolution of a planet in a multiple-planet system. We investigate the orbital history of the planet, focusing on the case of three planets with a semimajor axis a, b and eccentricity e.

In this work, we use the Gaia Data Release 2 (DR2) to perform a statistically complete and detailed analysis of the structure of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Due to the large number of observations and large radial velocity (RV) precision achieved, we have created a set of nearly complete catalogs of the LMC (\u223c1000 stars), which provides a rich source for comparisons and studies. We have performed a detailed analysis of all known flares in the catalogs, and we find that the flare frequency distribution function (FFD) exhibits significant degeneracy in the FFD. This degeneracy results from the fact that the flare should be detected and the detection probability should be known, but it is not. We have found two possible solutions to this degeneracy. The first one is that the FFD is not well determined. The second one is that the FFD is well determined, but the frequency of flares in the catalogs is not well known, thus the FFD is not well constrained. We present both results and discuss possible explanations.\nWe present a new method that can be used to determine the accuracy of an astrophysical signal that consists of two components: a light curve and a signal in the form of a Fourier transform. We use the Fourier transform to determine the shape of the light curve and the Fourier transform of the Fourier transform to determine the Fourier transform of the signal. This method allows us to perform a homogeneous analysis of the light curves obtained by an astrophysical signal. We use the method to determine the evolution of the surface brightness distribution of the Galactic disk (GDR) from LMC to Milky Way (MW) using the measurement of the stellar spectral lines (spectral line widths). The surface brightness function (Swell) from the surface to the disk (surface brightness) is determined by the Fourier transform.

The analysis showed that the main feature of the character-forming molecule is well-constrained. We found a well-known characteristic of the CO feature in the HADS J001528.20-304106.01 spectral line that is dependent on the orbital parameters and the position of the planet. The transit of the planet and the resulting absorption of the molecule were used as a constrained check on the validity of the orbital fit. A strong constraint on the orbital parameters was provided by the observed presence of the planet\u2019s spectrum. Our analysis of the transit times showed that there was no statistically significant evidence of any systematic effects.\nWe present a detailed model for the formation and early evolution of planetary systems around other stars that are badly affected by stellar irradiation. We assume that the stellar wind is dominated by disc and corotation torques and that the planet formation region is well coupled to the disc. We also consider the early evolution of the stellar wind using a simple model that assumes the stellar wind is neutral and that the stellar wind is charged. We find that the stellar corotation torque is generally too weak to drive planetary embryos through the disc before they are embedded in the disc. The evolution of the stellar wind can be driven by the planet formation region itself. We also consider the evolution of the disc and planetary embryos through the evolution of the disc towards the planet formation region, and the evolution of the stellar wind using the simple model of the disc being isotropic. We find that the disc is driven by the planet formation region, but at times the disc is also chaotic. The developmental timescale of this chaotic evolution is long enough that it cannot be entirely determined.\nWe present"}, {"Input": "", "Output": "Binary systems are a very common part of the universe. There is a surprising correlation between their properties and the properties of planetary systems. Here we study the correlation between the properties of binary companions and the properties of the planetary system around them and the comparison with the correlation between the properties of the binary planet around \u03b2 Pictoris. We analyzed archival high-resolution images from the Anglo-Australian Telescope and the Keck Telescope. We identified a clear correlation between the binary companion's orbital eccentricity and the planetary semimajor axis. The mass-ratio for the planetary companion to the primary is higher than for the binary companion, and the mass-ratio for the binary companion to the secondary is higher than for the binary companion. The mass-ratios for the binary companion and stellar companion are higher than those of the planet around \u03b2 Pic. Generally, the mass-ratios for the binary companion are higher than those of the planet around \u03b2 Pic because the angular separation of the binary companion is larger than the separation of the binary planet, but because the binary companion is more massive than the binary companion because the binary companion is close to the primary. The mass-ratios for the binary companion are higher than those of the planet around \u03b2 Pic because the planet is more massive.\nWe present a comprehensive study of the construction of the initial pileup caused by gravitational instabilities (GIs) in protoplanetary disks. In this study, we use a set of synthetic images generated with a three-dimensional smoothed particle hydrodynamics code to study the disk structure and dynamics. In a typical protostellar disk, there is a strong gravitational instability (GI) and a weak magnetic stabilizer (MS) that acts to stabilize the disk. In the presence of the strong GIs, the disk is highly eccentric, creating a steep radial density gradient that will result in a strong coupling between the disk and the GIs. The disk is time varying, with a time-dependent GI.

The radial velocity signal is in the form of a sinusoidal variation, with a semiamplitude of \u22739 m s-1 and phase of \u227330\u00b0. This is well reproduced by the transit model used in the discovery paper, but we cannot reach a statistically significant conclusion regarding the gravity of the system. The predicted transit depth is \u22733.2 per cent, in good agreement with the results of previous transit modeling studies. The radial velocity variation is also consistent with a circular orbit. We discuss the possible origins of the radial velocity variation and the methods for constraining its amplitude and phase.\nWe report the discovery of three new transiting extrasolar planets from the HATSouth survey.

We also find that the stellar companion is a low-mass red giant.\nIn the solar system, the moons Enceladus and Callisto orbit the planet, respectively, once every about 2.5 days. In the case of Europa, the moon's orbit is close to that of Callisto, and the planet is too far away to be observed with current instruments. Here, we show that the satellite is likely to be observed as a single-planet system, and that the moons can be used to obtain the solid masses of the host planet, which could be either inferred from their platoons, or inferred from their orbital characteristics. We show that the satellite formation time is about 105 yr, and that the moon system is strongly coupled to the planet, resulting in an efficient means to extract a planetary system from the disk, which is automatically. We use the satellite platoons to extract the system from the disk and to perform an intensive dynamical analysis of the system. We show that the satellites can be very strong dynamical entities and can drive the planet to the far-orbit in a way that is not possible by the standard dynamical modeling.

SUMER samples the spectra of the simulated point-spread function (PSF) of an observed star and produces a corresponding flux map.

In our first paper, we present a method for the extraction of PSFs and flux maps from spectra, using both spectra of the same star and spectra of a different star. The extraction performed is based on the assumption that the difference between the spectra is a free floating, that is, on the assumption that the spectrum is stable. In this paper, we extend the extraction to the case when the spectrum has a temporal variation, and we study the resulting flux-magnitude relation, which is one of the properties of the extracted spectra. This relation has been determined using the use of a linear combination of Fourier transform and linear interpolation methods, as well as using the use of a simulated spectra to correct for the effects of saturation.\nWe report the discovery of three new extrasolar planets from the WASP survey.

However, the mass regime observed in disks is not always consistent, and the disk masses inferred from accretion disks may not always be consistent with the observed masses. In this work, we investigate the disk structures and masses inferred from accretion disks in both protostellar and protoplanetary disks. We find that the disk masses inferred from accretion disks in both protostellar and protoplanetary disks are rarely consistent with observations and that the disk masses inferred from accretion disks may often be underestimated. We therefore suggest that it may be necessary to observe both protostellar and protoplanetary disks with the same precision to confirm the mass of an accretion disk.\nThe mechanism proposed to drive the formation of dust grains in protoplanetary disks is reviewed, with a focus on the role of gas dynamics in this process. In this review, we focus on the earliest stages of gas accretion and the role of disk dynamics. In this scenario, the material is assumed to have a range of initial sizes. The mass accretion rate in the disk depends critically on the initial size distribution of the grains, which depends on the varying accretion rate. In the limit of slow gas accretion, where the grains are assumed to be large, the gas accretion rate decreases as the initial size distribution of the grains is increased, whereas it increases as the initial size distribution is decreased. The disc is stable if the grains are large, but it becomes unstable if the grains are small. We give an analytical description of the disc's behavior under the gravitational influence of one or many bodies. We also find that gas flows efficiently through the disc, resulting in a net inward flux of material to the disk. However, as the radius of the gas is decreased, rather than being transferred directly to the disk, the gas slows down, and the flow becomes increasingly turbulent.

We calculated a sample of disks, including the disk around HR8799, for which the thermal inertia of a disk has recently been measured in the form of dust inward scattering. We also provide an estimation of the thermal inertia of the disk for the case where a uniformly rotating disk is considered. We find a value of 0.136 ms-1 for the disk temperature in the interior for the case where the thermal inertia of the disk is determined as a function of the disk radius and the turbulent velocity. These values are higher than those inferred from previous studies. However, we find no evidence for a strong dependence of the thermal inertia of the disk in the interior, i.e., the disk thermal inertia is not directly connected to the disk density.\nWe study the formation of dust grains in protoplanetary disks by the core accretion (C) mechanism.

A critical flux is found to have values that are consistent with theoretical predictions for fully integrated cores, while that critical flux is only reached if the internal energy flux is sufficiently reduced. The results show that the internal energy flux is sensitive to the internal energy flux for fully integrated cores.\nWe have computed the internal structure of fully integrated spherical shells. We have shown that the internal energy flux is proportional to the average radial distance of the shells on the internal surfaces of spherical systems of fixed radius. The sum of the energy fluxes associated with the movement of a shell inside or outside the orbit is given by the ratio of the energy fluxes and the mean radial distance of the shells. The value of this ratio is independent of the internal density and temperature structure.\nThe detection of planets around Sun-like stars is one of the main goals of the exoplanet community.

We have obtained 2MASS spectra of the three systems in the course of the LAMOST survey, and the spectra have allowed us to identify several new T Tauri candidates. These include KOI-1, KOI-1b, and KOI-1c. We have also obtained IRAS spectra of KOI-1 and KOI-1, and have been able to identify several new T Tauri candidates. Two of the identified candidates have spectral types of M8.5 V and M9 V, and are surrounded by three other candidates with spectral types of M9 V and later. Due to their very low proper motions (9.7 \u00b1 0.6 and 17.1 \u00b1 1.3 mas yr-1), weak proper motion (2.5 \u00b1 0.1 mas yr-1) and (incomplete) spectroscopic data, we have been unable to determine the nature of these objects.

The toroidal component can be computed from the results of the Coriolis force. The large-scale component, which is found in the decametric component, is computed from the results of the Keplerian orbit-of-diameter method.

Their differentiation is difficult, but has not prevented the two planets from intermingling. The most obvious outcome of this intermingling is that the Saturnian satellites are now largely analogs of the Asteroid and Icarus satellites, which were observed to migrate in the protoplanetary disk and ultimately merged with the Jovian planets. We demonstrate that if all Saturn and Jupiter formed from the original protoplanetary disk, then they could not have been captured into resonance. Instead, the moons could have migrated to the Jovian satellites and migrated in to intermingle with the Jovian planets. Jupiter could not have been captured into resonance with Saturn because Saturn's orbit is not eccentric. In addition, Saturn would have been too far from the Moon to be observed to interact with satellites. We also discuss the possible origin of Saturn's variation in orbital eccentricity.\nThe accumulation of evidence is mounting that the early solar system's moons were captured into mean motion resonances with the giant planets. Recent work suggests that the moons formed in a narrow annulus around the giant planets and migrated in from their orbits. We explore a simple model in which the moons migrated freely in the Jupiter-Saturn and Saturn-Centaur orbits as they grew from the moon-planet formation stage, and were trapped in the resonant chain. In this scenario, the moons were trapped in a 2:1 resonance with Saturn's moon Enceladus, which had recently formed the giant planet's satellites, and the moons were driven out of Saturn's orbit by Saturn's centrifugal force. We also consider an alternate scenario in which the moons were trapped in Saturn's orbit from Jupiter's orbit when Jupiter was embedded in the Oort cloud. The moons were trapped in Jupiter's orbit for a brief interval of time when Saturn's satellite, Prometheus, was in a stable orbit around Saturn, and then released as the giant planet's satellite, Titan.

The main focus is on the effect of the planetary magnetic field. The presence of a rotating planet can influence the rotation of the star. The magnitude of the magnetic field depends on the stellar surface rotation frequency. In the case of a rotating planet, the rotation of the planet can be detected by means of the Doppler shift of radio and/or X-ray emission. It has been shown that the presence of a rotating planet can cause the orbit of the planet to move in a highly eccentric orbit. The presence of a planet with a significant orbit can also alter the inclination of the star's rotation axis. The magnetic field of a rotating planet can affect the rotation of the stellar magnetic field.\nPlanets orbiting binary stars are the most common kind of extrasolar planets, but they are still under investigation. This paper reviews the current knowledge about the orbital properties of these planets, and the main observational constraints, such as radial velocity and transit light curves.

The discovery was based on follow-up observations with the Spitzer Space Telescope and the Herschel Space Observatory. The orbit of the inner companion is circular, with a period of 1506 days, and the eccentricity of the planet is due to the planet's proximity to resonance with the 2:1 mean motion resonance.

We find that the solar spectrum is likely to be observed at many wavelengths, but can be studied only at certain wavelengths. The observations are easier than the theoretical calculations, as the spectral model gives a continuous flux across the disk and the full-disk model produces a continuous flux across the disk. The atmosphere is assumed to be transiting and the disk is assumed to be circular. The model produces an estimated frequency of solar flux as F sstarf = (1.5 \u00b1 0.2) \u00d7 10-9, which is not significantly different from the frequency of solar variability as observed at other wavelengths.\nWe present the results of the first analysis of a detailed UV/VIS (4.5 \u03bcm) survey of low-mass stars (0.1 &lt; m_i \u2264 20 m) in the Taurus Molecular Cloud, using the IRAM PdBI and the VLTI/AMBER instruments on the 3.6 m telescope at the ESO Antu observatory.

In this work we investigate how the structure of the flux distribution in LX Cha depends on the stellar mass, planet-to-star mass ratio, and dust properties.

For Jupiter, we consider the invariance of the velocity and the radius of the planet at each epoch to be an observational constraint. For Saturn, we incorporate the effect of rotation on the radial and vertical structure of the disk to determine the disk-driven formation mechanism for the formation of the giant planets.

This suggests that the two planets may have undergone a dynamical breakup. The apparent conflict in the TTVs suggests that the two planets are initially on slightly eccentric orbits, but subsequently contracted to become nearly circular. We also provide constraints on the period of the transient phase of the observed TTVs.

In the case of the Earth-Sun system, we treat the planet as the spectroscopic input and compute its RV using the Hansen-Condon approximation. If the planet is close to the host star, then we compute the velocity of the star in the space of light curves. If the planet is far away, then we compute the velocity of the star in the space of light curves. The method has the advantage of not having to invoke any assumptions about the properties of the host star, such as stellar mass, radius, and effective temperature. In this case, it is the difference between the method's parameters that are important.

However, the planet-to-star flux ratio can be strongly correlated with each other, which is a problem for transmission spectroscopy and allows for the possibility of estimating the exoplanet's radius and mass from the photometric variability of the star. Here, we present a novel method for the extraction of exoplanet masses and radii from Doppler emission spectra using absorption lines extended to the optical wavelength. Using a Fourier-transform spectroscopy technique, we extract the stellar absorption lines that are likely present in the planetary atmosphere. For each wavelength, we look for absorption lines that can be associated with the planetary absorption lines. We detect several strong correlations between the spectra of the planet and the star, which makes this technique a powerful tool for planet mass determination when the planet does not have a well-constrained reference, such as is the case for HD 209458b.

We use a 3D smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) code to follow the evolution of the water ice plume and its emission and retention properties over 10 orbits.

Methods: The dust distribution and radial-velocity (RV) distribution of dust particles in the disc are computed using a one-dimensional model which includes the effects of Rotation and Coriolis forces. The numerical results are presented in the form of a set of equilateral triangle models. Results: We find that the dust distribution in the disc is not uniform, as is generally assumed. The dynamical results are qualitatively similar to those obtained when the dust is assumed to be locally isothermal. The RVs and CVs of the dust are both determined from the observations, but the CVs result are significantly steeper than predicted from the model. Therefore, the effect of the magnetic field on the dust formation processes is not as important as generally assumed. The gas in the disc is not uniform, but is asymmetric in shape and density; its composition is not essential for the calculation of the RVs. Conclusions: In one respect, the results imply that the dust composition of the disc is not important. The results suggest that the dust density is not uniform in the region in question, but that the gas density may be variable.\nWe present a summary of the first results from our multi-object spectroscopic survey for low-mass companions of massive stars.

In particular, for the inner ring we find that the best-fitting model with respect to the data is significantly inferior to the best-fitting model with respect to the ring temperature.

The activity of solar analogs is strongly correlated with their rotation period and the solar activity cycle. We also find that the rotation period is not the only factor affecting the magnetic activity. The influence of the stellar magnetic field is discussed in the context of solar analogs and the Sun as well as other stars.\nWe show that the stellar rotation period, and hence the stellar magnetic activity, is a fundamental parameter in determining rotation periods and activity cycles. We present two different approaches to determine this information: (a) the traditional approach, which is based on the measured rotation period, and (b) the application of the method of Pearson-Nesvall (PNK) to the available observational data. We apply both method to the large number of visible solar twin candidates discovered by the so-called Kepler Short Cuts (SCCs). We find that the traditional approach provided by Pearson-Nesvall can provide poor information in the sense that it does not include information on the stellar rotation period. The PNK method provides satisfactory information on the stellar activity cycle, but there are significant differences in the way in which the two approaches obtain the results.

We present a novel Bayesian analysis of the light curve of the Sun, which yields the planet masses and orbital parameters with a precision comparable to that of a radial velocity survey. We show that the light curve of the Sun can be used to detect planets orbiting a wide range of stars, with the best targets being L_\\star  and M_\\star  of the 1-2 M_\\odot range. We combine this method with a novel approach for determining the likelihood of the planetary signal by computing a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMCMC) analysis. We apply this method to all known planets with orbital periods from radial velocity surveys, in order to determine for which cases the planet mass and orbital parameters can be determined. We also consider the case of planets found by the radial velocity method, showing that for a wide range of orbital parameters, the mass can be determined with a precision comparable to that of a radial velocity survey.\nThe first detection of the H\u03b1 emission line in the northern and southern hemispheres of Jupiter was reported in the year 2000. Since then, the line has been detected in a few other hot Jupiters, but most of these have been only detected in the spectroscopic regime. We review the observational properties of the H\u03b1 line in Jupiter, including its broad-wavelength distribution, its temporal evolution in the atmosphere, the detection mechanisms, and their possible implications for the planet's radiative mantle properties. The H\u03b1 line is a relatively bright feature (L = 40 m s-1) in the brightness of the Jovian atmosphere, which makes it an ideal probe for determining the rotation rate in the planet's atmosphere. At the present time, the H\u03b1 emission line is observed only in the atmosphere of Jupiter, so it is unclear if this feature has a physical explanation. Although the H\u03b1 emission line does not appear to be a strong function of the planet's rotation rate, it is possible that"}, {"Input": "", "Output": "The last two decades have seen great progress in the study of the physics of planetary atmospheres, including a growing understanding of the chemistry and formation of clouds and hazes.

The two transiting planets are hot Jupiters orbiting in the habitable zone (HZ) around their host star, with periods of 6.01 and 8.77 days, and radii of 1.28 and 1.48 RJ. The properties of the target stars are determined and the planet candidates, as well as the stellar parameters selected, are being followed up. The two planets are sufficiently close to have a mass-loss rate of about 3.5 \u00d7 10-10 MJ in the case of CoRoT-7b, and are therefore expected to have a planetary atmosphere. The planet candidates are also sufficiently close to their host star to be within about 1.5 au of the host star. By comparing the transit light curves of the two systems, we determine that the planet candidates have similar transit depths and thus they are likely to have similar radii.\nWe present a study of the orbital evolution of hot Jupiters around their host stars. We use a robust and an efficient method based on N-body simulations to examine the orbital evolution of close-in Jupiter-mass planets around their host stars for different initial conditions. A statistical technique based on Bayesian statistics is employed to determine the probability of a planet forming in a disk similar to that observed around the Sun. The results of the N-body simulations confirm that the initial conditions are highly and significantly degenerate with respect to each other.

The candidate planet has a mass of 12.8 \u00b1 1.1 M\u2295 and a radius of 2.13 \u00b1 0.43 R\u2295, which is consistent with recent models of brown-dwarf-like planets in the habitable zone. The planet is found in an 11.2 \u00b1 0.5 day orbit around an M2-dwarf. We combine this with the results of our previous follow-up studies of K2-11 b and c, and find that the planet may be located within the brown-dwarf-only zone.\nAsteroseismology represents a unique and powerful tool to map the surface of a star in time. The ability to accurately measure its fundamental parameters, such as stellar radius and radius of the host star, allows us to place precise constraints on the geometry of the solar system. With the recent discovery of the first moon around the planet, we are now able to place similar constraints on the moon's surface. In this paper, we calculate the moon's seismic parameters for an Earth-Moon mass ratio of 0.5 and a mass of 17 Earth-masses. Under the assumption that the moon is constantly inhabited, we find that the seismic parameters can be constrained in the presence of moon-like objects. We then apply the moon's seismic parameters to the Moon's orbit, interpreting the satellite's seismic parameters in the context of the lunar bombardment. We find that the Moon experienced a significant bombardment during its formation history. We then use the lunar shadow to infer the lunar surface's seismic properties, including large-scale seismic oscillations. We investigate the qualities of the seismic oscillation in the lunar shadow, and conclude that it can be used to infer the seismic parameters of the moon.\nThe generation of stellar radiation is a key process in the solar system, and"}, {"Input": "", "Output": "Jupiter is the only planet besides our own that has been directly imaged. The planet's orbit is well known to be circular and to have an inclination of about 45\u00b0; there is no evidence for any other planets in the system, with the exception of a possible third plane object. We need to determine whether Jupiter is aligned with the orbital plane of the other planets in the system, and if so, if so, how. We use new 3-dimensional numerical simulations to show that if Jupiter is aligned with the orbital plane of the other planets at the moment when the others are aligning, the alignment must have been achieved through dynamical evolution. We consider that the alignment can result either from the precession of a body around the Sun or from the orbital evolution of a body in the solar system. We calculated the evolution of Jupiter's orbit from the start of the disk inwardly and find that the precession of the orbit of Jupiter can be deduced from the disk geometry. The precession can be deduced from the effect of the planetary eccentricity on the disk geometry.\nAn analysis of the data obtained by the Cassini spacecraft during a flyby of Saturn in the summer of 1998 shows that the planet shows a complex velocity field. The velocity field is tangential to the planet's orbit, and its nature is unknown. In most of the flyby data, the velocity field is tangential to the plane of the sky. However, the velocity field is actually radial to the plane of the sky. The velocity field is found to be so complicated that it easily overwhelms the effective bandwidth of the Cassini spacecraft. The conventional method for discovering planetary signals is to use the frequency content of the data, but the method is inefficient because the two components of the signal are strongly correlated. We suggest a new approach: instead of using the frequency content of the data, we describe a method that automatically searches for signatures of neighboring planets using the Hipparcos or Gaia Space Motion System.

The analysis has revealed that these stars have rotational modulation features that are modulated by the presence of hot spots on their surface. These spots are usually located in the convective region and are heat sources. By considering the existence of hot spots on the surface of these stars, we have obtained an empirical relationship between the rotational modulation of H2O and the rotational period of the star. The relationship between the rotational modulation of H2O and the rotational period is presented and discussed.\nWe have measured the rotational frequency of hydrogen near 2.5 \u03bcm for a sample of 78 stars, including 18 that are known to have jets. The results show that the average radial profiles of H2O and CH4 lines are well matched by the spectra, but two types of lines, the first with the emission lines at 2.5 \u03bcm and the second with the lines at 3.3 \u03bcm, are detected at a slightly higher level than the average level of the other types. We have also determined the H2O column density for the sample and found that it is below the levels of the other stars. This indicates that the H2O abundance in the other stars is normal. The number density of H2O in the sample is found to be not very different from that in the other stellar samples, which indicates that the abundance pattern is not very different from that of the other groups.\nWe have searched the Keck NIRSPEC catalog for infrared excesses due to accretion, dust, outflows, and jets.

The resulting model, which includes a large number of particles, is compared to a detailed description of the ring optical properties, including their orbital evolution and the locations of the dust and gas emission regions. We then perform numerical simulations of the evolution of the rings, including the effect of the rings' collisional evolution. We find that the rings evolve dramatically in time. Ring evolution produces a large radial ring of particles, which may be observed as a ring system. The rings evolve in time, producing rings that are very similar to those observed in the solar system. The rings in our model produce a ring system with a total dust content of about 21 000 km and a ring-like structure. The ring system is stable because it is surrounded by a gas disk. However, in case of an eccentric ring, the ring system can evolve into a resonance that produces a ring system with a smaller dust mass. We find that the ring system can survive an extended period of evolution due to ring-system tides, which can last up to about 105 yr. We find that the ratio of the ring mass to planetary mass is set by"}, {"Input": "", "Output": "The auto-magnetic and turbulent nature of the magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) flow in protostellar disks is reviewed.

With the advent of the transiting planets, the method is now extended to the look for outer planets using the radial velocity method. In this work, we analyze the radial velocity data, MCMC, for the known extrasolar planets. We provide constraints on the planets' orbital parameters based on the known parameters of the system. We simulate the MCMC of a planet detected by radial velocity and determine the mass and radius of the planet, the moon, and the stars that host the planet. We find that the mass of a Jupiter-like planet around a Sun-like star is not a free parameter, so that the mass and radius of the planet must be constrained by a dynamical mass. We can set a lower limit, under which the mass of the planet is large enough for the moon to orbit around the planet. We also compare our results to the results of two previous published studies on the same planet. Both results indicate the planetary mass and radius to be significantly larger than previously estimated.\nWe present the first comprehensive study of the radial velocity (RV) variations observed in several stars associated with extrasolar planets, using the HARPS spectrograph mounted on the ESO 3.6 m telescope.

We determine the baryonic acoustic oscillation (BAO) and \u03b3-ray (\u03b3) frequencies for PSR J0357+6123 with an accuracy better than 5%. We detect two main modes with amplitudes of about 0.01 cm-1 and about 0.0011 cm-1 and timespans of about 1.6 s and about 5.5 s, respectively, indicating that the pulsar channel is dominated by low-frequency modes, and that the high-frequency modes, apart from being confined to the \u03b3-ray band, propagate independently of the BAO and \u03b3-ray emissions. The baryonic acoustic oscillation spectrum obtained from the baryon acoustic oscillation spectrum for the BAO mode is well fitted by a power law with index about -2. The characteristic time scale of the baryonic oscillations is Thin/I=180/360 s, which corresponds to the Boltzmann time scale. This is also the time scale of the high-frequency mode.

The method of using eccentricity as a tracer of the moons' orbital parameters has been suggested as a way to find the moon population around planets. In this work, we study the long-term dynamical evolution of HD 104936 b and c with the aim of determining if the moon population around the planet has undergone significant change during the \u223c3 Gyr of moon-forming events that it experienced prior to the Moon-forming giant impact (MBI). We find that the moon population around HD 104936 b has undergone a strong evolution and that the dynamical history of this moon-hosting system is not unique. The moons' orbital inclinations are large (e &gt; 0.4) and are presumably related to the orbital eccentricity of the planet. The moon's orbital inclination is most likely not unique, either, since the Moon-forming giant impact was preceded by a large moon-hosting moon. The moon's orbital parameters are not resolved and it is not possible to unambiguously determine the moon's orbital inclination, but the moon's orbital eccentricity is constrained to be small.

To do so, we simulate solar system orbital evolution with two masses, one of which is closer to the Sun (about 0.5 M_\u2609) and the other of which is farther away (about 0.5 M_\u2609). We then use these simulations to test whether the mass-period and semimajor axes consistent with the observed halo of the solar system's orbital elements can be established from the observed solar system orbital structure. We find that, for the mass-period plane, the mass-period assumptions hold for both the mass-period plane and the eccentricity plane, and the semimajor axis-mass plane. However, for the semimajor axis-mass plane, the mass-period assumption does not hold, and the two planes are not coupled. In order to reexamine the mass-period assumption, we first examine the evidence that the solar system's orbital plane is inclined relative to our line of sight.

Recent studies have identified a substantial contribution from hot dust by way of dust condensation radially outward from the central star. We revisit this theory in this work, which focuses on circumstellar disks that are spatially extended and with substantial gas surface density near the surface. We use two different methods for identifying the radial extent of the disk: direct imaging with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and modeling of the ALMA data with a combination of spectral filtering and spectral synthesis. We find that the disk surface density near the disk midplane is highly sensitive to the dust properties, which are characteristically down to the logarithmic scale, and thus the fraction of dust is only weakly dependent on the mass of the disk. We show that the \"hot disk\" concept is sensitive to the gas surface density. In this regime, dust condensation can significantly contribute to the disk mass, and the disk surface density can also be a significant factor in the observed gas. This leads to a dramatic decrease in the disk masses of planetesimals and asteroids, and decreases the overall mass of the disk, with a strong dependence on the gas surface density. These effects lead to the formation of a massive planetesimal belt (M \u2272 4 M\u2295) with a substantial contribution from hot dust. We also find that the hot disk concept can yield an additional acceleration effect for debris disks: they can experience a large increase in disk surface density when the dust condensation region is approached. Observed gas lines in the H2 and He I lines show evidence that the disk surface density is closely related to the gas surface density, and thus the total disk mass is likely to increase with the mass of the disk (and dust).\nWe present the first results from a deep survey of dust continuum emission in the Orion Nebula (PN) with the Near-Infrared Stargazing Network (NIRSPEC) instrument, including high-resolution ("}, {"Input": "", "Output": "The next generation of high-dispersion coronagraphs uses two deformable mirrors (DMs) spaced apart to produce an intensity beam. Our approach to this problem is to use a single deformable mirror to generate two beams of very close (\u22720.1 \u03bcm) overlap and to use a deformable secondary mirror to generate an intensity beam between them. Such a setup has been proposed for use in space missions such as the Extremely Large Telescopes (ELTs). This paper considers the two-mirror approach to generate two beams of overlap using the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) and the Multiband Imaging Photometer for Spitzer (MIPPS) on the Hubble Space Telescope. We analyze how the two-mirror approach can be implemented in the laboratory and in actual missions. We then apply this setup for the SPHERE mission, which has a single telescope and a large number of deformable mirrors. We show that the two-mirror approach can be implemented in a simple and effective manner. We show that the two-mirror method produces a more uniform (larger) beam of overlap between the two beams of overlap of the two-mirror approach, reducing redundancy and the efficiency of the coronagraph. We also present a simple method to test the efficiency of the two-mirror approach by comparing the published results for the twin-mirror approach with the published results for the single-mirror approach.

We analyze all of the available data for a wide range of initial mass ratios for single protostars and for parallel protostars, and we use a Monte Carlo procedure to follow the accretion process by introducing a narrow Gaussian fit to the data. We also consider the role of the protostellar disk in the disk mass flux distribution. We find that planets form rapidly when the disk mass is low, while they form slowly when the disk mass is high. This is consistent with observations that find that the disk is the dominant source of mass accretion in the inner disk. The disk mass flux has a strong dependence on the disk mass. If the disk mass is low, the flux is high. If the disk mass is high, the flux is moderate. We have also derived the evolution of the accretion rate onto the protostar in the presence of the disk mass and the initial mass ratio. We find that the disk mass in the high mass regime is not a function of the initial mass ratio because the accretion rate onto the protostar is not sensitive to the disk mass. We also use this result to study the relationship between mass accretion and stellar mass.

We simulate the evolution of the dust particles in the disk using a grid of model simulations including the disk as a particle model, assuming different grain size distributions and different initial radial distances. We determine the radial drift speed of the dust particles due to the drift of the planet-induced dust particles. We find that the radial drift speed is determined by the growth rate of the disk gas at different radial distances, and that the growth is proportional to the logarithmic logarithm of the growth rate in the disk, which is usually expressed by the logarithmic or exponential growth rate. We find that the growth rate in the disk gas is determined by the critical size of its grain, which is the largest for the largest grain size.

We find that the way an orbiting planet increases its semimajor axis depends on the specific kinetic energy it is able to produce. We show that, for a planet that orbits in resonance with its larger host star, it can undergo an orbital circularization that is much faster than its Roche limiting circularization time. If the planet is able to produce a large enough semimajor axis, it can undergo an orbital circularization period that is much shorter than the period of the resonance that it is currently in. Thus, it can enter the resonance after a long time. As a result, it can become a hot Jupiter, which depends on the orbital parameters of its host star and the distance from its host star.

The planet has a 1.8\u00b10.3-d period and is located within the habitable zone, where liquid water can be present. We observed the transit with the same instrument, the same observing technique and the same data reduction technique as we did for the HD 209458b-like planet. We also present the results of the radial velocity follow-up of the WASP-12b system, which we achieved by means of the SOPHIE spectrograph at the Observatoire de Haute-Provence. The radial velocity of the planet shows no variations above the level of 0.08 m s-1. This result implies that the planet is a planet with a radius around 1.5-1.7 RJup and orbits around a G-type star with a period of 4.0-5.6 d. We estimate the mass of the planet to be around 0.38 MJup, which is in agreement with the mass estimate of 0.29 MJup found before the discovery of the system by the WASP consortium. We also find no evidence of a stellar companion at a distance of 20-30 pc. We estimate the 2\u03c3 upper limit for the mass of the stellar companion to be 5.2 MJup.

However, the moon may play an important role in determining the planet's habitability if it orbits the moon-hosting planet. Here we study the dynamics of a moon orbiting the planet with a full moon orbiting around the host moon via N-body simulations. We find that the moon's orbital eccentricity can affect the planet's orbital eccentricity and hence its habitability. We also find that the moon-hosting planet's orbit has a semimajor axis that is larger than the moon's orbit. If the moon is in a very close orbit around the planet, then the moon can survive on an extended period of time without any tidal interaction with the planet. If the moon is not close to the planet, then it can undergo strong tidal interaction with the planet. In this case, the moon can undergo convection in its interior and orbital eccentricity can be excited to very high values. We also find that the moon can possibly be affected by stellar radiation pressure and that the moon can lose mass from its host planet.\nWe present the analysis of a wide-field M dwarf survey of the Taurus star-forming region.

In spite of the small angular separation between the two stars, they are clearly detected in the H and K bands. The time-series photometry confirms that the astrometric motion of HR 2396 is consistent with a zero-proper-motion star. The comparison with the Hipparcos astrometric data suggests that HR 2396 has a mass of 1.75 \u00b1 0.35 M\u2609, a radius of 1.39 \u00b1 0.06 R\u2609, and an effective temperature of 1590 \u00b1 150 K.

In this work, we present a comprehensive, consistent and empirical framework for the interpretation of CVs based on the main physical parameters (effective temperature, surface gravity, and projected rotational velocity) measured by the CoRoT space telescope.

The most interesting of these is the transit of a planet to a low-mass star or brown dwarf, which may provide an additional clue to its formation and evolution. We use the transit time to study the orbital parameters of the planet, the stellar activity of the host star, and the planet's orbit. We identify eight previously unidentified planetary systems with orbital periods of less than 10 days. Because of the small orbital period of the planet, it is assumed that it has formed and migrated through the system.

An Earth-like planet orbiting a G2V star with a 1.5 day orbital period (Bean, 1999; Chang, 2007) is found to be within the habitable zone of the planet. This result is contrasted with a similar planet orbiting an M3V star (Bean, 1999; Chang, 2007) which lies within the habitable zone. In the example of Bean, 1999, the activity level of the star is only marginally variable and the influence of rotation on the planetary radius is marginal.

We identified these molecules in the ISM by means of the imager-spectrometer method, not using any other method. The detection of CO2 shows that the ISM contains a large population of gas molecules that have been further depleted by means of the high-resolution spectroscopy method. The depletion mechanism can operate in a wide range of conditions, with different origin and time-scale of depletion, and is thus likely to be complex.

Depending on the initial disk mass, one or more planetesimals form in each simulation, with masses ranging from 0.5 to 100 M \u2295, depending on the mass distribution of the planetesimals. The number of planetesimals determines the final disk mass as a function of time. When the initial disk mass is very low (less than 10 M \u2295), the disk accretion rate is large enough to thin out the disk mass over timescales of about 10 Myr. In this case, the disk mass is not a function of the initial disk mass, but rather a function of the initial disk mass, the accretion rate, and the temperature. This is because the disk mass can be a function of the initial disk mass and the disk accretion rate. We find that the disk mass is an important factor for determining the minimum mass of planetesimals. We find that the minimum disk mass can be constrained with current observations because the disk mass can be inferred from the light curves of young stars by fitting the observed disk oscillation frequencies.\nWe present a detailed study on the dynamical stability of planetary systems consisting of embedded planets, due to the gravitational interaction between the planets and the disk gas.

In this work, we show that planet e and planet f are in resonance, and hence, the solution to the resonance is also in resonance, and we show that there is no evidence for a second planet in the system. We also show that, although the system is sufficiently well-characterized that it may be difficult to safely discard planet e and planet f, our results indicate that there may be another planet in the system with a mass that is not yet known.\nWe present a detailed study of the formation of the first planetesimal disc in the inner disc of the protoplanetary disc around GJ 581 (GJ 581-B). According to previous theoretical work, we show that the planetesimal disc within the first \u223c 70 au can be a simple two-planet system with planets b and c situated on a circular semi-major axis. The initial planetesimal disc is sufficiently large for planet b to have formed through runaway growth, and the mass of the disc is sufficient to allow planet c to grow to a mass of a few Jupiter masses. However, due to the presence of planets b and c, the disc is dynamically unstable. In order to explain the formation of the planetesimal disc, we propose that the planetary embryos formed through runaway growth were able to accrete material from the disc, which efficiently mixed with the gas in the region where planet b and c are located. The planetesimal disc is thus slightly enriched in material relative to the minimum mass solar nebula. We also explore the possibility that the disc was dynamically unstable due to the planet's density, and that some of the material accreted onto the planet, which could have triggered the instability. We conclude that the planetesimal disc is still"}, {"Input": "", "Output": "The outer planets in the current system, Proxima Centauri, are Earth-sized and have a period of 9.1 days. The inner planet, Proxima b, has a period of 34 days. We study the dynamical evolution of the system and the possible formation of planets orbiting either Proxima Centauri or Proxima Centauri. We first use the orbital angular momentum vector (OAM) method to study the orbital evolution of the system. We find that Proxima Centauri has a relatively long period and that it is probable that it formed in a system with a significant eccentricity. We then compute the orbital evolution of Proxima Centauri and Proxima b with a non-Gaussian fit that accounts for the effect of the stellar binary and the binary companion. We show that the system is stable for a wide range of possible orbital parameters. We compute the present-day orbital parameters of Proxima b by performing N-body simulations of an evolving system with masses and periods of 2.0, 5.5, and 100 days. We also study the orbital evolution of Proxima Centauri. We find that the present-day orbital parameters of Proxima Centauri and Proxima b are strongly correlated. The eccentricity of Proxima b is usually small, e\u2264 0.1, which makes it difficult to determine if the system is in a stable configuration. We conclude that the present-day orbital parameters of Proxima b are unlikely to have been formed in a disk. The present-day orbital parameters of Proxima Centauri are consistent with the results of dynamical simulations. Finally, we find that the orbital angular momentum of Proxima Centauri is likely to be conserved in a secular way. This means that the system is unlikely to have been assembled in a disk.\nWe report the detection of the first extrasolar planets detected by radial velocity (RV) observations from the CoRoT (COnvection ROtation and Planetary Transits) space telescope.

We searched for new companions to the known members of the classical T Tauri star (cTTS) and classical T Tauri star (cTTTS) associations, focusing on the mass and period ratio distribution of known companions with periods of 4-18 months. We found an increase in the frequency of new cTTTS with periods of 28-37 days, but no increase in the frequency of cTTS with periods of 60-90 days. We also detected a decrease in the fraction of known cTTTS with periods longer than 40 days in the tTTS sample, although we did not find evidence of significant trends with this period. We found that the mass distribution of known companions is consistent with that of the star and the tTS sample. We also find that the period distribution of known cTTTS is best fitted by a power law as seen in the tTTS sample. We also find that the mass distribution of known cTTTS is similar to the tTS sample, suggesting that the observed cTTTS mass distribution is not biased toward short periods. This is consistent with the hypothesis that the observed period distribution is not biased. We find that the mass distribution of known companions is not significantly different from that of the tTS sample, suggesting that the observed companion mass distribution is not unique and that the observed mass distribution is representative of the tTS population.

Next, the atmosphere and modeling are solved in a set of mutually consistent two-stream models with a solution of the form k(T)-k(V -I)2 = (1 - t/T)2(2)3/2 and \u03b3\u03c12(T)/ \u03b3\u03c1  = (1 - t/T)2(2). The temperature profile is solved in the same way as in the ideal case, but the temporal resolution is doubled. The spectral energy distributions are computed using the quadratic limb-darkening law, and the coverage of the spectral features is extended in a similar way to the ideal and two-stream models. From the simulations, we show that the two-stream approximation is more accurate than the quadratic one-stream approximation for the case when the two streams are equal in time and the temperature profile is well approximated. However, a violation of the quadratic law is observed when the two streams differ in their coverage of the same feature.

We provide a simple physical model to help interpret the observed distributions of initial mass function and radius. We show that the observed properties of stars are consistent with a distribution that is a linear combination of the measured properties of stars with respect to the age of the universe. We derive the physical properties of stars with a variety of initial masses and metallicities. We describe the evolution of stars in a variety of initial mass functions and find that the average mass evolves over the age of the universe is similar to the observed properties. For stars with the highest observed properties at early times, we find that the average mass evolves as a function of the stellar radius, and that the rate of change of the mass is much shorter than the age of the universe.\nWe present the present results of a study of the velocity amplitude of the Galactic bar, using the nearby M2.5V star HD 106906 and its companion, HD 106860B, whose light curve has been recently analyzed.

In particular, it is impossible to have predicted the Sun's geometry or, more likely, the Sun's orbital parameters2,3. Here, we use the solar system as a crude approximation to estimate the tidal evolution of planets with masses ranging from the Earth to Neptune. We find that the planet eccentricities of the three moons Enceladus, Kerberos and Callisto could be explained reasonably well by a series of dynamical simulations that incorporate a ring-like planetary structure. We then use the planet's orbit as a probe of the internal evolution of the moons. We show that, if the moons are eccentric, they can be explained as a result of tidal dissipation in the planet's interior. This means that, for a given moon's eccentricity, the tidal evolution of the planet can be represented by a simple set of equations that only apply on the Moon's orbit. We predict that the moons should have lost their moons' cores when the moon's orbit migrated away from the inner solar system. This resulted in a large mass loss from the satellite orbits, which is contradictory to the observed orbital eccentricity of the moons. We show that moons Enceladus and Kerberos lost most of their moons' mass when the Sun was still a low-mass star. Motivated by this, we suggest that the moons be observed as a small perturbation in the orbits of the planets they maintain.\nWe report the detection of an eclipsing binary system (EB) with a circumbinary mass ratio of q=2.2\u00d710-5 and an orbital period of 14.3 d, which was confirmed with three independent radial velocity measurements.

We find that the dynamical evolution is largely determined by the planetary mass ratio and mass transfer has little impact on the final formation locations of the binary. In contrast, the orbital period and semi-major axis of the binary are largely controlled by the initial mass ratio. The mass transfer is most important for wide-orbit companions that migrate inwards more slowly than the orbital period.\nThe K2-16 planetary system (P = 6.7 d) was identified from Doppler radial velocity (RV) observations when the first planet was discovered in March of 2009.

We find that the critical surface density is a function of the nonlinear acceleration factor and the parameter of the perturbation, and that the turbulence has a nonlinear character. The perturbation can cause changes in the cloud structure and dust opacity, which may lead to changes in the time scale of the evolution of the turbulence and the evolution of the critical surface density.

It is shown that, although the disk is obviously not in a steady state, it is possible to picture a stop-timescale that is chaotic and corresponds to the dynamical evolution of a disk if the mass accretion rate onto the disk is large. In the disk model, the mass accretion rate onto the disk is determined by the fraction of photons that hit the disk. If the disk is unstable, the mass accretion rate onto the disk is small, and the disk is a dust disk. If the disk is stable, the mass accretion rate onto the disk is large and the disk is a disk.\nWe present the first results of the CHaracterizing ExOPlanet Satellite (CHEOPS), a new survey for compact planetary systems orbiting bright stars. The CHEOPS observations obtained with the SMARTS 1 m telescope have revealed the existence of an unusual population of planetary systems: more than half of the detected planets have orbital periods in the range between 60 and 800 days. Among the planetary systems discovered, two systems are significantly more massive than Jupiter (with periods up to 10 Days) and a fourth system contains more than one planet (with a range of periods ranging from 1 to 10 days). Although the mass limits of the detected planets are still relatively high, the period distribution of the detected planets is different from that of the mass-period plane (MSPS). The lower mass limits of the detected planets imply that most of them are in multiple planet systems, i.e., their orbits are likely to be dynamically constrained to within a few percent. We suggest that the low-mass limit of detected planets is indicative of either (1) the planet formation process being considerably more efficient than previously thought, or (2) that the planet population detected is not inflated and that the inflated planets are actually planets in disks, and that the fraction of stars harboring multiple planets is at least"}, {"Input": "", "Output": "The Karhunen-Wallis Catalog of Nearby Stars (KAL) contains information from the latest catalogs of starlight scattered by planets and from the literature.

It is suggested that the growth and retention of dust grains in the disk of the inner disk is driven by a large planetesimal population. If planetesimals, which have been suggested to be responsible for the growth and scattering of dust grains, can be formed in situ by the disk instability mechanism, then they can play a significant role in the planetesimal formation.\nContext. The detection of small extrasolar planets is of great importance for the characterization of exoplanets and for their migration.

In order to assess the presence of extra-solar planets within our habitable zone (HZ), we estimate the radial velocity (RV) (or the transit probability) for each planet. A more precise RV measurement of a transit with a high-precision photometric time-series is important for the determination of the planet-to-star radius ratio (R/R*), the number of planets, and the planet-to-star mass ratio (q/q2). We use a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMCMC) algorithm to study the impact of stellar activity on the RV of the planet, and we consider the effects of the stellar activity and the planetary orbital inclination. To this end, we perform a SAMBA code to study the impact of stellar activity and the planetary inclination. We find that stellar spots, which can cause a significant RV skew, can cause a systematic shift in the RV of the planet in orbit. The RV signal due to a spot is mostly suppressed by the stellar rotation. The RV signal due to the planetary inclination is largely unaffected by the stellar activity. We interpret the RV jitter caused by stellar spots as the result of the planetary orbit being eccentric. The spectral appearance of the stellar spots is modulated by the stellar activity. We also find that the stellar activity induced by spots is more sensitive to the stellar inclination than the planetary inclination. We conclude that the RV jitter due to stellar spots can be measured with high accuracy and significance for a given planet and that the RV jitter can be used to constrain the inclination of the planetary orbit.\nThe Kepler mission has detected more than one thousand exoplanets and is regarded as one of the most sensitive and accurate transit surveys in existence.

The detection of planets in the habitable zone of nearby stars, in combination with precise determinations of planetary radii and masses, has led to the possibility of detecting Earth-like planets and establishing their presence in the habitable zone. The use of radial velocity and transit techniques, however, is subject to the uncertainties in their orbital parameters, which in some cases are much larger than those in the transit methods. In this paper, we review the uncertainties in the planetary radii derived from transit methods, focusing on the case of the Earth-like planets. The uncertainties in the planet radii are typically only about 10 per cent larger than those in the transit method, and the extra data obtained by the latter are of similar quality. For the case of the Earth-like planet HD 209458b, which is the closest known planet to host a rocky planet, the uncertainties in its orbital parameters are only a factor of 2 larger. We show that the uncertainties in the orbital parameters are not sufficiently explained by the transit method. Instead, we propose that the planet is likely to have a low eccentricity. We therefore conclude that the transit method provides a more accurate determination of the inclination angle between the planet's orbit and the host star's equator. The stellar oblateness, which is an important factor in the planetary orbit, is more accurately determined by radial velocity observations, and thus the planet's oblateness can be deduced from the transit method.\nWe study the stability of the system around the star HD 80606 by considering a series of stable orbital configurations that a 1-Myr period planet could have obtained by radial velocity observations.

The most common way of modelling condensate aerosols is through collisional fragmentation; however, fragmentation is not always complete, which may result in aerosols that are too dry or too warm. We investigate the effect of fragmentation on the aerosol production of condensates in a two-dimensional (2D) model, and investigate the constraints on the cloud formation and particle size. We find that hot gas clumps formed in the haze layer can be large enough (up to 50% of the cloud mass) to fragment enough to produce aerosols that are too dry or too warm, and that the gas/dust ratio in the haze layer can be significantly smaller than in the rest of the atmosphere. In the presence of thick clouds, the 2D effect on the aerosol production is also important. In this scenario, the aerosols are largely composed of water condensates (H2O). However, condensate aerosols formed in the cloud layer (i.e. those in the gas phase) have a much smaller mass and size ratio in the gas phase, so they are not able to fragment.

KIPA is designed to perform NIR differential spectroscopy (AD) of extrasolar planets. The instrument includes a dual-beam adaptive optics system and a pupil-tracking instrument for both the pupil and the telescope pupil. We measured the stellar spectrum and atmospheric parameters for all targets in the two bands simultaneously in a single observing sequence and combined the results to produce a final product that includes both the spectral and photometric light curves of the system.

We thus show that the planet\u2019s atmosphere can be subjected to a high degree of solar irradiation. We may note, however, that the effect of this radiation depends upon the specific properties of the host star. We examine, for example, whether a planet orbiting a metal-rich star receives enough inflow to affect its orbital inclination significantly: we show that the effective temperature of the planet is strongly correlated with the host star\u2019s metallicity. We further wonder whether the observed orbit of HD 209458b is in fact an anomalous non-axisymmetric orbit or an anomalous eccentric one: we calculate that the probability of this hypothesis is 1 in 4. Our result suggests that the presence of extrasolar planets is not a strong enough constraint on the formation models to suggest that planets are preferentially found in eccentric orbits.\nAstronomical observations over the last two decades have revealed a diversity in the compositions of exoplanets, which can be grouped into two broad categories: (i) Super-Earths (super-Earths with cores of less than 10 M\u2295) that have peaks in the mass-radius relationship, and (ii) Transit candidates (transit candidates that have a high likelihood of being planets). In this contribution we focus on the former group, which have cores of 5 M\u2295 and reside in the transition region between super-Earths and its constituent groups.

This structure is not found in the optical spectrum and is consistent with an accretion disk with an inclination of only \u224850\u00b0. The extreme spectral resolution of the optical spectrum is sufficient to resolve the spectral window and measure the flux of all the detected sources.

However, because of the small amplitude of the radiation, it is difficult to measure the power spectral density (density) over time as a function of the age of the star.

We use the spectra of the Sun as a template and obtain the surface convection model (SPM) in the form of a three-parameter (heat, luminosity and density) finite-difference method. The SPM is then used to compute the mean spectral power at each order of the accretion luminosity. If the accretion luminosity is sufficiently high, we find that the SPM can be used as a proxy for specific heating efficiencies, which can then be used to estimate the time of the solar core collapse.\nThis paper presents an analysis of the spectral energy distribution (SED) of the brown dwarf WISE J125500.01-125723.1 (W1255-1257), a system with one M9.5V component and a T9.5V component that is located in the Taurus Molecular Cloud.

We analyze in detail the evolution of the tracer gas composition of the Saturnian satellites during the orbit of Jupiter and Saturn. Using the Jupiter probe orbiter's science camera, we determine the tracer gas composition from the tracer gas composition during the Galileo probe orbit to determine the distribution of tracer gas compositions throughout the orbit. We find that the distribution of tracer gas compositions is well approximated by a linear combination of a constant fraction of the tracer gas composition with a fractional value that depends only on the total amount of tracer gas and the ring density. The distribution of tracer gas compositions is approximately constant between the rings and the rings themselves. From the tracer gas composition, we determine the ring density for the rings.

We use the newly established Lidov-Kozai theory of migration to calculate the migration of large planetesimal orbits in the asteroid belt. We show that the observed orbital architecture of the asteroid belt can be reproduced by a single mechanism: the core accretion scenario, which is based on the core growth and decoupling of gas and solids from the gas and solids in a protoplanetary disk. In a planetesimal disk that is gravitationally unstable, the planetesimal orbits are generally unstable and migrate inward via the Lagrange points LPL and LPL2. When the planetesimal orbits are sufficiently closely packed and the disk is sufficiently massive, the growth rate becomes negligible. However, when the planetesimal mass \u03a3 is much less than the minimum mass in the disk, the planetesimal can migrate inward via the LPL2 only if the disk is extremely massive. We address the issue of how often this mechanism operates in protoplanetary disks. If the disk is gravitationally unstable, then planetesimals can migrate inward via the LPL2 in a fraction of the cases studied. The mass of the disk is the parameter that determines when the migration rate is negligible. If the disk is gravitationally stable, then the migration rate is governed by the disk properties and the planetesimal mass is strongly correlated with \u03a3.\nContext.

The companion is able to colonize the inner disk region. We then perform a one-dimensional numerical simulation of the evolution of a disk with a companion in its birth environment. We find that the planet is able to enter the disk early and undergo mass exchange with the disk gas. We also find that the disk mass can evolve away from the planet just after the disk has lost a significant amount of mass, as long as the planet is able to survive to form.\nThe final stages of disk evolution are unclear, and the formation of protoplanetary disks remains a mystery. The formation of planets, however, is a possibility. We investigate the disk evolution during the planet formation epoch by considering the impact of a planet on the disk surface by using a one-dimensional model assuming a planet migration model. The parameter T_eff is the disk's temperature and the planet mass is of the order of 10 M_Jup. We neglect the effect of the planet's mass on the disk's evolution. We find that the disk is unlikely to evolve into a perfect Keplerian state. However, it could evolve into a disk with nonzero residuals that decay with time. The disk is likely to rotate slowly allowing for an inward migration of the planet due to the tidal pull of the disk. A planet can form in the disk once its orbital period is \u223c1 Myr. This time period is shorter than the planet's disk lifetime. The disk can then accrete material from the disk as it continues to accrete inward due to the gas flow from the planet. We find that the disk must accrete material from the disk at a rate that is sufficient to explain the observed properties of disks at large heliocentric distance.

In this work, we study the effect of tidal dissipation in a protoplanetary disk on the radial migration of a planet undergoing type I migration. We consider two different distributions of disk parameters (effective temperature, surface density, and disk thickness) in the disk: one with (temperature, mass) = (5-100)\u00d710-3 K and another with (temperature, mass) = (5-10)\u00d710-3 K. We find that the disk thickness is mainly influenced by the initial orbital distance of the planet. When the disk thickness is higher than 20 au, the planet starts its radial migration at its current apoastron distance. Its eccentricity decreases as it approaches 1 au, while its orbital period increases with decreasing orbital distance. The orbital migration rate depends on the disk thickness and on the disk mass. The disk thickness is larger for smaller disk masses, but due to disk heating, its effect is not as large as migration by a ring, for example.\nWe calculate the orbital evolution of a giant planet in a disk of planetesimals.

We present the results of two parallel studies which illustrate the effects of the planet eccentricity on the planetesimal accretion rates. The first study shows that if the planetesimals are in a quasi-equilibrium state, the radial migration of planetesimals can be slow, i.e. the time to complete the whole migration is much longer than the total time required for all the planetesimals to reach the final condition. The second study shows that if the planetesimal eccentricity is large, then the time required for some of the planetesimals to reach the final condition may be significantly longer than the total time required to complete the migration.\nWe study the dynamics of a protoplanetary disc composed of planetesimals.

The radial drift of grains results in a population of small dust grains that can migrate inwards and form radial dust rings. Orbital migration of these dust rings results in the formation of dust belts in the form of elongated rings. These rings can be observed as transient emission peaks in the disk image.

The presence of a gas disk and radial drift of grains can lead to dust grains that migrate inward to larger distances than their mass can accrete, which may lead to the accretion of dust in the ring system. The presence of a gas disk can also lead to the formation of rings involving less massive grains.

We thus discuss the possible causes or causes for the observed characteristics of the pulsation modes in the \u03b4 Sct and classical \u03b4 Scuti stars.\nWe describe the automated determination of temperatures and radii of the SDSS 2MASS J00131244+3315129 spectroscopically and photometrically for the two pulsating variables in the \u03b4 Sct binary system. We analyze the light curves of the two components with the code of Barnett et al. (\\citetahah). The light curves were obtained through Fourier transform spectroscopy. The temperature and radius of both stars were determined. The results show that the temperature of the primary is steeper than the temperature of the secondary. It is also suggested that the radii are smaller than for most SDSS variables.

The data were obtained using the MIKE and AMBER instruments at the Very Large Telescope Interferometer. Our observations reveal that HAT-P-3b has a molecular composition typical of giant exoplanets and is therefore expected to have a large atmosphere. The ultra-violet absorption lines imply the presence of a large planetary atmosphere in the region L = 60-70 au, while the remaining absorption features are not strong enough to constrain a vast atmosphere. We find that HAT-P-3b is a good candidate for studying the interaction between the planetary atmosphere and the stellar wind in transmission and emission.\nWe present a detailed study of the transit depth asymmetry (TD) in the HD 209458 system.

We use three different methods to measure the TD: parallax, tomographic imaging, and tomographic integration. We find that the parallax method is not sensitive enough to detect the TD for HD 209458b. We illustrate the limitations of using this method when compared to other techniques. The TOMA-I method can only be used with a higher precision, but gives a good approximation to the TD.

Here we report that the Kepler sample of planets discovered in the mission is consistent with the one that is not: the one that contains planets too close (a few au) to the host star. We extract the planets that are expected to have formed in this scenario from the Kepler Input Catalog. We find that the majority of the planet candidates that we identify as having formed in this scenario are indeed present in the Kepler mission data, but the number of candidates that are not is surprisingly low. We find that the majority of these candidates have formed beyond the orbit of the outermost planet in the system, and that the true number of planets that are too close (a few au) to the host star is likely to be lower than previously thought.\nWe examine the role of potential modes of oscillation in the classical nova V838 Mon in explaining the large-scale light curve of the recently discovered Kepler Objects of Interest (KOIs).

We found that the dispersion relation is fairly insensitive to the choice of the dust surface density distribution function (DSF). However, the observed dispersion relation is highly truncated by the presence of a significant dispersion component (DSF) which is the down-side of the standard DSF. We consequently need to make a careful choice of the DSF of the Gaussian process model.\nThe orbital properties of known exoplanets located in multiple systems are studied in a large sample of confirmed candidates. It is shown that the two most common route to orbital confirmation through multiple-planet candidates is simply through a photometric transit.

We present a detailed modeling of the RV signal due to stellar activity in an attempt to determine whether it can be used to infer the presence of planets. We find that the RV signal can be used to select exoplanets from the RV data.

We investigate this issue by exploring the parameter space of (i) the planetary orbital periods, (ii) the dynamical histories of the planets, (iii) the history of the system and (iv) the orbital elements of the planets. We find that the system parameter can only be determined by careful study of the dynamical histories.

The orbital parameters of the exoplanets are derived from the light curves. We find that, for four targets, the derived orbital parameters are independent of the orbital inclination. Three of these planets are in mean motion resonances. The derived RV parameters for the fourth, and possibly the last, target, is uncertain.

We show that the two-dimensional Gaussian regression method is significantly more accurate than the quadratic regression method, which is commonly used for the detection of a non-linear trend in radial velocity data. We also find that the two-dimensional Gaussian regression method can be used to detect two other trends: one that the planet is slightly more massive than the host star and a second that the planet has a significantly larger semimajor axis than the host star.

In this work, we investigate the influence of the wind dynamo on the orbital configuration of the planets around the Sun, taking into account the evolution of the orbital eccentricity of the system. We count Newtonian and non-Coplanar forces, the orbital mean motion of the Sun, and the effect of the magnetic field on the flow. We consider the case when a magnetic field is not present, and the system is in a quasi-closed state where the magnetic field is corotation, and the tidal mean motion is aligned with the orbital plane. The results indicate that the dynamo affects the flow substantially when the solar wind is open, and the flow becomes increasingly more chaotic when the solar wind is corotation. The corotation and orbital plane in the closed state are not aligned. The corotation and orbital planes in the open state are not aligned if the solar wind velocity is below a critical value Vout, which is determined by the magnetic field strength. The numerical results also indicate that the planetary orbit is not aligned with respect to the stellar spin axis. We also find that the system is not in a stable configuration when the solar wind velocity is below a given value Vout, which is due to the corotation and orbital planes being aligned, but when the solar wind velocity is sufficiently high.\nWe present the results of a study of the physics of the interaction between a solar wind plasma flow and an accretion disk.

Here, we investigate the formation of a trail of densities by planet-to-star flux flow from a disk with a short disk lifetime, which is unstable for high disk mass, low stellar insolation, and a moderately long disk lifetime. The mass-loss rate due to the disk mass-loss is found to be low and the flux flows are not strongly affected by the stellar wind. The planet mass flux is found to be not a significant source of mass loss for close-in planets. We demonstrate that the mass flow can be driven by stellar wind pressure instead of tidal torques from the disk.\nWe report on the on-going collaboration between astronomers and planetary scientists exploring the implications of the current and next-generation transit surveys for the detection and characterization of exoplanets. This is possible by means of the SPACE Interferometry Mission, which is an international collaboration among 40 observatories dedicated to the detection of light scattered from exoplanets.\nWe present an analysis of spectra obtained with the VLTI/PIONIER instrument at the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI).

The masses of the two planets are consistent with the core mass of 0.365 \u00b1 0.012 M\u2609. The radius of the planet is larger than that of any brown dwarf currently known, and we find that its mass is consistent with that of a typical brown dwarf. This suggests that the planet is not a candidate planet in the mass-radius plane, but instead has a mass that is consistent with a planet with a mass corresponding to that of Jupiter, and therefore is not a planet in the mass-radius plane either.Based on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555.

This means that the two stars are likely to be near the base of the red giant branch, or even at the same stage. It is therefore possible to use the angular momentum deficits of these two stars to constrain the mass of the planet in a nearly-mirror-like fashion. Since the planet is undergoing mass loss through evaporation, the angular momentum deficit of the two stars can be transferred into the planet's orbit through the super-Earth region of the star. We study the dependence of the system's structure under the effects of mass loss due to evaporation. We find that, in certain regions, the system can have four planets with masses similar to those of the Earth around the central star. In others, the system may collapse to three planets, but the system is unlikely to do so by meteorology alone. Here, we present the result of our analysis and show that the system can be stable for currently known exoplanets.\nThe origin of a planet\u2019s mass and thus the origin of the planet\u2019s interior structure is an important factor in planet formation and evolution. Here, we investigate the gravitational interaction between a planet and a protoplanetary disc using two-dimensional smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). We first study the orbital evolution of a planet by solving for the planet\u2019s orbital parameters. We then derive their radial positions in the disc by solving for the disc orbital parameters. We then consider the formation and evolution of the planet\u2019s interior structure by solving for the planet\u2019s interior parameters. We find that the planets have different interior structure parameters that are determined by the planet\u2019s bulk composition. For icy planets, their mass is typically much greater than the mass of Jupiter, whereas the interior is mostly constrained in the range of 0.1-20 M\u2295.

The first one is a study of the elliptical profile of the inverse-square law with its substitution in the solar wind potential. The second one is a study of the radial profile of the cubic epicyclic potential. In the first approach, we have investigated the effect of the momentum trapping of the solar wind on the coronal structure and the solar wind structure. The solar wind structure is a homogeneous system with a variation in the radial distribution of the matter. We have also investigated the effect of the solar wind mass transport on the corona. The solar wind phase diagram is shown to be well fitted by one complete region in which the matter varies in radial extent and in its density. The second approach investigates the effects of the solar wind mass transport on magnetospheric matter, consisting of the mass transport via the cold corona of the magnetosphere. In the observed coronal structure, the cold corona is mostly tilted to the Sun's orbital plane. In the simulations of the mass transport, the matter is transported to the stellar surface and the local corona is tilted. In the simulations of the mass transport, the corona is also tilted with respect to the Sun's orbital plane. The tilt of the corona is determined by the solar wind dynamic pressure. A variation in the solar wind dynamic pressure causes a variation in the solar wind velocities. The tilt of the corona is determined by the mass transport relative to the solar wind velocity. Here the solar wind dynamic pressure, as well as the mass transport, is given by the ratio of the mass flux of the solar wind to that of the stellar wind.\nThe total mass of bodies produced by collisions in protostellar disks is generally of moderate to low order (e.g., q &lt;about 10-3) in most disks.

This is true for both an elevated temperature (T&gt;1000 K) and a low temperature (T&lt;300 K). This is especially true when using the infrared flux spectrometer (IRF) because the temperature dependence of the electron number density can be roughly constrained. Therefore, we find our method can be used for both T&gt;1000 K and T&lt;300 K, and it can be used for both T&gt;1000 K and T&lt;300 K, and it can be used for both T&gt;2000 K and T&lt;300 K. We explore the parameter space to determine which ionization states can be reliably determined from the IRF data. In particular, we consider the effects of the ionization state. We find that the ionization state can be reliably determined by the IRF data alone, but it may be more challenging to determine the ionization state from the T/K data alone because the total flux is likely to be greater. We also find that the spatial distribution of the electron number densities (e.g., \u03a3/\u03a3\u221d\u03c1) can be determined from the T/K data alone, but it is not possible to determine the spatial distribution of the total flux because the total flux is likely to be much larger than \u03c12.

The planet radii are typically determined by the ratio of the stellar radii (often expressed in terms of the stellar radius) and the theoretical radii (often expressed in terms of the planet radii) when the planet is too small or too large for the stellar radius. The planet radii are typically determined from the planet's radius when no other mass is available for the planet. This is usually accomplished by a two-planet model in which the planets are initially placed as one large planet and then allowed to migrate to their current locations. In some cases, the planet is initially extended and the migration is stopped. The migration can continue for up to a billion years. Earth-like planets orbiting Sun-like stars can be observed in the same way as Jupiter and Saturn. However, the migration can be stopped for a smaller planet in the habitable zone of the star. This can be achieved by a method that uses a large planet to move the star closer to the star. The planet's orbital eccentricity and longitude of the ascending node can be measured, and the planet's velocity can be measured.

These categories are based on the criteria of potential energy surfaces, which are constructed from a set of thermodynamic properties of a fossil which are accessible via the theory of thermodynamics. In this paper we present a full description of this theory. We have provided a comprehensive description of the kinetic and potential energy transfer in the first category, and we have shown that a second category may be found in which the internal energy source is thermodynamically coupled with the internal heat flux. In the second category we find that a third category of fossil is decomposed into those which are thermally coupled and not decomposed. In all cases the energy sources are thermodynamically coupled to the internal heat flux.

Using three-dimensional smoothed particle hydrodynamics and radiative transfer, we study the effects of the mantle on the thermal relaxation time-scale and heat flux of the mantle. We find that the cooling time-scale of the mantle is generally smaller than the thermal relaxation time-scale for convection. If, however, the mantle is not thin, as suggested by the thermal relaxation theory, the cooling time-scale is typically much larger.

In such cases, the search for planets is often complicated by the fact that some of the targets are not very nearby.

The H2O absorption arises from the planet\u2019s magnetosphere, and is most likely caused by the planet\u2019s magnetic field. We measure the radial velocity of the star with velocities that place it in the region between the two known binary companions of HD 49933.

We exploited our environment to study the effects of the plasma and ionized particles ejected from the nucleus. Results: We detected the comet's outbursts in the UV and the IR, confirming their significance and the presence of an extended tail behind the nucleus. The time-averaged fluences of the outbursts were found to be consistent with those expected from a slow decay of the material of the nucleus. The outbursts were not detected at the time of the observations, but their quality was better in the IR. The total outbursts seen in the IR were longer than those seen in the UV, and the total ejected mass was larger in the UV. The total mass of ejected particles was found to be higher in the UV, as expected for a shorter decay of the material. The number of ejected bodies did not exceed 1.5 \u00d7 107 kg. Our results support the hypothesis that outbursts are driven by the mass loss from the nucleus. The outbursts in the UV were preceded by a period of about 20 h, during which the tail of material from the nucleus was outflowing.

The evolution is driven by the magnetic fields, and is not strongly affected by the Coriolis force. The corotation torque is a weak function of the stellar mass. It is a relatively slow function, and is not a major factor in the evolution. The magnetic field structure in the disc is not determined by the Coriolis force. We find that the Coriolis force has a strong effect on the corotation torque. The corotation torque is mostly affected by the size of the stellar magnetic sphere and by the effect of the stellar wind pressure on the field lines.\nThe evolution of protostellar discs is not straightforward, and the environmental conditions in such discs are not immediately obvious. It has been suggested that a collisional cascade in a low-mass disc could produce a large-scale turbulence in the disc that could result in the formation of rings in the dust, but the physical processes involved remain to be understood. Here we report the first direct measurements of a ring in a 10-Myr old planetary-mass disk that is undergoing a collisional cascade, under the influence of an optically thin, highly magnetized external magnetorotational instability.

In particular, we consider the hydrodynamic mass flow and absorption of stellar radiation at high altitudes. We use a simple two-stream method to model the planet's atmosphere using a simple two-stream radiative transfer scheme. We then calculate the planet\u2019s transmission spectrum in the transmission using the JKTEBOP code. We find that the planet\u2019s atmosphere is expected to be well fit by a well-constrained, well-determined transmission spectrum. The planet\u2019s atmospheric composition is constrained because two measurements of its bulk composition, the H2O mixing ratio and the CO-to-CO2 ratio, are uncertain. This is because the mass loss rate onto the planet is controlled by the mixing ratio of the H2O-rich atmosphere and the CO2-rich atmosphere, but the mass loss rate onto the planet is not controllable to the radiative transfer scheme. In addition, the mass loss rate onto the planet is not determined by the planet\u2019s bulk composition because one can only determine the H2O mixing ratio.

Since the mission is sensitive to planets with a period longer than about 200 days, there are also short-period planets that are not being detected. Here, we study the properties of those planets and the possible detection of a period longer than the Earth-Sun period. We take the assumption that planets have a large tidal locking mechanism and that the planet is rotating synchronously. We find that this mechanism is unlikely for a variety of reasons: (i) the tidal dissipation rate decreases with increasing orbital period, (ii) the planet has a high eccentricity, and (iii) the orbital period is not too long.\nWe present a spectroscopic analysis of the M8.5 dwarf 2MASSW J1207334-393254, which was recently discovered as a candidate for accreting hot Jupiter.

Results: We find that the transition region of dust disks has a strong dipole component that is independent of the disk position. It is also a strong mode that can be excited by magnetorotational instability. The density of the dust is strongly dependent on the radial location of the disk, but it is also a weak mode with a very steep rising-to-lying profile. The peak of the mode is located in the outer disk radius, 0.09\". This is consistent with the results of previous studies. The dominant mode is a partial sine wave with an amplitude of 0.008\".

However, the escape process for HD 209458b is not understood to well enough detail to allow us to draw firm conclusions on the planetary loss mechanisms. To help with this study, we study the atmospheric dynamics of HD 209458b in a three-dimensional, time dependent planetary escape model. We find that, at short wavelengths, the planetary atmosphere is lost due to hydrodynamic drag in the planetary wind and thermal escape from the planet. However, at longer wavelengths, the atmospheric escape is time dependent and is influenced by the planetary magnetic field. The planetary magnetism is modulated by the stellar magnetic field, which has a strong influence on the planetary escaping winds.

The evolution of the clumps is described by a series of linear equations which describe the evolution of the body in the form of a sphere. The two most important parts of the model are the treatment of subsurface convective dynamics and the treatment of quasi-static acoustic oscillations. It is shown that the subsegmentation of the turbulent flow at the surface of the body in the form of a sphere is not only possible, but also is a necessary precursor of the formation of the clumps. The clumps form in the turbulent regime and mature in the same way as the subsegmentations in the turbulent regime. The evolution of the clumps is described by a series of linear equations which describe the evolution of the body in the spherical coordinates. In the first part of the evolution, the body is described in terms of the surface density (radius), surface density (radius), and full width at half-maximum (FWHM), which are the two independent parameters of the model. In the second part of the evolution, the clumps are defined in terms of the boundary conditions in the turbulent regime, which are the vertical profile of the density versus radius relationship and the pressure ratio between the two sides of the vertical profile. The three independent parameters of the model are the size of the inner lobe and the width of the inner lobe. The observational evidence of nonlinear evolution of the clumps is discussed in terms of the scale length of the clumps and the shape of the inner lobe.

The main focus of this work is on the formation of Uranus and Neptune in the presence of Jupiter and Saturn. It is shown that Uranus formed with a significantly reduced mass in the presence of Jupiter, while Neptune formed with a substantially reduced mass in the presence of Saturn.\nThe formation of Jupiter and Saturn in the presence of Jupiter and Saturn is a complex problem that requires a comprehensive treatment of the formation of the Solar System. The main thrust of this paper is to provide an exhaustive treatment of the formation of Jupiter and Saturn in a consistent way, and to assess the relative merits of different models of the evolution of the Solar System.\nWe describe an algorithm designed to efficiently determine the multiplicity of the Solar System based on the planetary system geometry, which is known as the \"geometry of a binary system\". The algorithm, called GALAH, computes multiplicity by computing the Kepler, Str\u00f6mgren, and Jackson-Keenan multiplicity indices and computing the resulting multiplicities for a binary system. The algorithm was designed to be flexible in terms of the set of the multiplicities, and the range of parameters that can be parameterized, and can be given arbitrary constraints on the multiplicities.

The population of planets detected is expected to be predominantly of Jupiter mass, but a significant fraction of them will have already been detected in the original mission data. We use the SOPHIE array to observe six CoRoT targets in the G band, observing a total of 16 targets in the K band. The RVs of these targets are fitted to the same formulae as in the original mission data, and so all our light curves are available for comparison.

The dynamical model is used to study the evolution of the internal orbital eccentricity of Jupiter. The results of the two models are compatible to within a factor of 2. The solution determined by the two models is that the eccentricity of Jupiter is stable over the interval 0.5-100 AU from the central star, and is not subject to conversion to a fixed orbit. The internal orbital eccentricity is determined in the same way as in the model by applying a semi-analytic method. The result of this analysis shows that the dynamical model can reproduce the observed orbital eccentricity of Jupiter over the interval 0.5-100 AU. The model also reproduces the observations of the circumplanetary circumplanetary resonances, where the orbital eccentricity of Jupiter is determined by the propagation of the force due to the circular momentum transfer between the planet and the circumplanetary disc. The numerical solution indicates that the orbital eccentricity of Jupiter is likely to be constant or decreases as a function of the time between the time of the period of the inner coma collapse and the time of the onset of the migration.\nRecent works have shown that highly eccentric Jupiter-mass planets are likely to undergo runaway inward migration due to tidal circularization. We investigate whether the orbital evolution of such planets is different from that observed in our own solar system, where the orbital eccentricity is driven primarily by the gravitational quadrupole of a distant planet. We show that the resulting migration rate is much larger than that observed in our own solar system. We discuss the resulting consequences for the formation of highly eccentric Jupiter-mass planets in close orbits around main sequence stars. We also compare the observed orbital evolution of Jupiter and Saturn, and show that in both cases the migration is more rapid than predicted by the theory.\nThe chemical composition of the atmospheres of hot Jupiters is a crucial ingredient for understanding their thermal emission properties and thermal processes.

The astrometric data reveal the orbit of HR 1099 to be well matched with the one determined from the radial-velocity data.\nWe study the effect of a magnetic field on the rotation of the photospheric or circumstellar disks around A-type stars. We use two properties of field-aligned disks: their shape and their inclination. The three-dimensional shape of the field is determined by the geometry of the disk and the inclination of the disk relative to the plane of rotation of the central star. The disk inclination can be measured by observing the disk in scattered light using the radial-velocity technique. For HD 114715, we have detected the disk inclination by finding both the peak of the radial-velocity variations obtained from the Fourier-transform spectroscopy and from the three-dimensional shape of the disk. We then determine the disk mass and position relative to the central star. For A-type stars, we find that the disk mass is a function of the average magnetic flux received from the disk and the average magnetic inclination of the disk.

We use the code MASTEL to model the evolution of a planetesimal disk as it is formed, and the evolution of dust grains produced by it, during the disk formation. The multi-step evolution of the disk is treated by employing a hydrodynamical code to model the fragmentation of the disk. The disk is assumed to be 100 au in radius. The time-dependent evolution of the dust grains is computed by repeating the calculated evolution times for different initial conditions. We investigate the dependence of the evolution on the initial conditions by using a time-dependent approach. We also perform two-dimensional smoothed particle hydrodynamical simulations to investigate the formation of dust aggregates on the disk surface. We find that the evolution of the disk is determined by the conditions of the initial conditions, and not by the initial location of the planetesimal disk. In particular, the evolution of the dust grains is determined by the evolution of the disk viscosity parameter Q as a function of the distance to the planet. In the disk formation case, we find that dust aggregates are formed in a narrow region in the disk at radial distances \u2a861 au, which can be fitted by Q\u03b7 = 10-4. We also study the evolution of the dust disk with a sub-micron-sized dust grain at 100 au in radius.

We focus on the mass-radius relationship which is the primary determinant of the formation of Jupiter and Saturn.

Finally, we finally discuss the prospects for the detection of planets in a wide range of orbits, including close to the orbit of Neptune.\nWe demonstrate that the correlation between the transiting planet Proxima Centauri and its stellar companion, XO-2, is not statistically significant. The observations do not support the hypothesis that the two systems are in a four-way double-mode resonance.

Their spectral type distribution is well fitted by a linear function with a slope of -2.27 to -0.50. The distribution of the 2D elemental abundances of the NDTs in the L-T transition is also fitted by the same function.

The orbital period of Procyon b is \u223c1.905 d, while that of Procyon c is 9.872 \u00b1 0.044 d. The mass of Procyon b is consistent with its discovery from radial velocity (RV) measurements, but the mass of Procyon c is more ambiguous because of the presence of a possible additional planet in the system. This discrepancy may be due to the planet's eccentricity, but it cannot be distinguished from the fact that the RV signal is dominated by a stellar corona. In addition, we find that Procyon does not have a significant eccentricity, which is inconsistent with the predictions of previous works by which eccentricity is often attributed to the presence of an extra planet in the system. The presence of a third planet in the system, as well as the eccentricity of Procyon b, cannot be determined from RV data alone. The inner planet is likely to be in a 3:1 mean-motion resonance with Procyon c, and the outer planet may be in a 3:2 or 4:3 mean-motion resonance with Procyon b. We also examine the dynamical behavior of Procyon due to its three-planet configuration, which should have produced a symmetric 3:1 mean-motion resonance if the third planet was initially located at a significant distance from the binary.

We can distinguish between the two different approaches by examining how the apparent semimajor axes (a and b) of the planetary orbits are shifted relative to the orbits of the transiting planets, which are not necessarily defined as being of the same mass, but orbiting different stars. We find that when the planet is in the habitable zone (HZ), all planets are large (a &gt; 0.3 MJup), and the HZ is straight (a &gt; 0.1 AU), but the orbits of the transiting planets are not affected by the presence of a companion star. In such a system, the planet is not in the HZ. If the planet is in the HZ, however, then the semimajor axes of the transiting planets are shifted relative to the orbits of the planet, and the planet orbits in the HZ. The planet is not nearby and the semimajor axes are shifted toward the larger one. The effect of a second star is studied by considering the system as a whole. We find that the semimajor axis of the orbit of the planet is shifted away from the location of the companion star due to the presence of a second star that could orbit the planet.

The disk mass could also decrease gradually over the life of the disk, so that it becomes insignificant at later times. The disk mass could be increased by an order of magnitude or it could increase more slowly, so that it becomes insignificant at later times.

A few decades ago, only a handful of planets were discovered around other stars, but over recent years more than a dozen planets have been announced around other stars. For a variety of reasons, no single planet is able to satisfy all the requirements for habitability, while the habitability of a planet depends on different factors. The presence of a third body can affect the habitability of a planet, but it is not a compelling reason to explore alternative methods for detecting planets. We show, however, that the detection of planets is likely to be a significant source of uncertainty for a significant number of exoplanets. Therefore, it is important to have a comprehensive understanding of the planet population before proceeding with planet detection.\nWe present a description of an ambitious new space mission, ExoMars, to be launched in 2026. ExoMars is a multi-purpose, wide-field, low-cost space mission to search for and characterize exoplanets and their moons, and ultimately to search for life on terrestrial exoplanets. The mission is based on the concept of a two-stage robotic rover and a space telescope.

The system evolves through a series of resonances with eccentricity e2 and inclination i2. The system is sensitive to the initial conditions, which leads to a rapid decrease in the orbital eccentricity.

We consider the stability of a resonant planet at a similar inclination angle under the influence of a companion star that rotates faster than the planet.

We have performed a study of the rotational period determination of the B, V, and R stars in the solar coronal mass ejection (CME). We investigated the relation between the rotational period, chromospheric activity, and the spectral signature of chromospheric activity in the M and G dwarfs area using archival data of the IRAC instrument on the Spitzer Space Telescope and updated information from the HARPS spectra. The radial velocity (RV) measurements of individual stars were also used to determine the surface differential rotation (SDR) of the sample. The derived rotation periods of the individual stars were then used to calculate the SDRs of the entire sample and to compare them with those of the solar case. The results show that the rotational period of the sample can be determined with a confidence level of 95% for stars with a mean activity level of 22.4 m s-1. In comparison, the solar case can be determined by an average of 99% at the 20% level.

The spectral features of the planetary signal are mainly determined by the disk mass loss and the planet mass. We model the energy-limited escape from the planetary atmosphere by assuming that the stellar UV flux is a typical disk wind, and that the planetary atmosphere is optically thick. We also calculate the disk mass loss due to the mass loss due to the planet's escape and compare this to our current understanding of planetary mass loss. We also investigate the effect of the planet's mass loss on the planet's orbital characteristics. We find that a massive planet orbiting in the habitable zone of a relatively inactive star (active \u2273 50 per cent) has significantly more mass lost during its disk lifetime compared with its low mass.\nWe revisit the question of whether the inner Kepler planet candidate KIC010851506B is a true planet or an artifact of the data.

In this work, we study the impact of uncertainties in these parameters on the determination of the HZ for a hypothetical host star, based on stellar models with N-body simulations. We find that the impact of luminosity uncertainties decreases with increase in effective temperature (i.e., with effective temperature, effective temperature, and surface gravity), but decreases with the increase in radius (i.e., with radius). The inclusion of effective temperature uncertainties can lead to an increase in the HZ, but changing the radius uncertainty can lead to an increase in the HZ. However, for a given effective temperature, the stellar surface gravity is typically not important for HZ determination. We also find that the impact of stellar surface gravity uncertainties can be reduced by increasing the radius of the planet, which is a result that is dependent on the stellar mass. Finally, we also show that the HZ for a star can be determined by solving the mass-radius duality, which is a result that is independent of the stellar mass.\nWe report the detection of three extrasolar planets from the CoRoT mission, CoRoT-Exo-2b, CoRoT-Exo-3b and CoRoT-Exo-4b, detected using the CoRoT signal detection method.

We find that the evolution of the planetesimals is dominated by the growth of planetesimals in the circumplanetary disk. The embryos' collisional evolution is also influenced by gravitational interaction with the disk gas. As a result of all their collisional interaction, the embryos' surfaces are covered by a dust layer and their temperatures increase with the gas surface density. The dust layer is denser than the gas layer and thus the gas pressure there acts as a temperature energy source for the embryo's radiation and heat flux. The radiation and heat flux from the planetesimals' surface generates a strong heating of the gas, which, in turn, leads to the formation of a hot gas disk around the planetesimal. We also find that the gas region at the planetesimal's location is highly warped, because of the gravity, and therefore inhomogeneous mass distribution of the embryos. The gas pressure at which the embryos' bodies penetrated the disk does not depend on the embryos' location in the disk, but the gas surface density and the inclination between the disk midplane and the embryo's location.

To estimate the planet-to-star flux ratio, we constructed a transit light curve with the receiver operating characteristic of an I-band spectrograph and fitted the inverse of the planetary radius for resonance lines spanning the full range of the planet's disk. The resulting spectral energy distribution (SED) is fitted to a radial velocity (RV) model assuming a circular orbit. The resulting SED is fitted to an inverse regression model in the visible band with the receiver operating characteristic of an I-band spectrograph and the inverse of the planetary radius for resonance lines spanning the full range of the planet's disk.

It is based on the idea that the peak-based extraction method is a limited resource, and that its efficiency is mainly driven by the incomplete or removed flux distribution of the data. We present the PIONIER algorithm for the extraction of spectra from the DFS (Dynamic Fitting Statistics) data base, which is the most extensive catalogue of observed spectra in the universe. The algorithm consists in determining the required signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the extracted spectra and the number of peaks needed to fit the observed spectra. This process is then applied to the extracted data. The algorithms are designed to work with both spectra from the full DFS and from the \u03c72 function, which are available from the CDS (Data Dimensionality Sorting) database. The algorithms are tested on published spectra and the PIONIER pipeline is designed to work with only the DFS spectra, which is a direct extension of the algorithm.

In this work, we study the SLO of a Jupiter-like planet orbiting in the habitable zone of its parent star, and explore the sensitivity of the planet's climate to its orbital parameters (teacher, planetary mass). We find that the atmosphere of the planet is sensitive to the planet's orbital parameters (radius, period, and gravity). In particular, the planet's orbit under glint can be significantly different from the true orbit of the planet. Furthermore, the atmosphere can be highly extended (wavelength and time-dependent) relative to the planet's equatorial plane. We also study how the atmosphere changes with a change in the gravity (orbital period and orbital period) and the planetary mass (recession of the naked body with respect to the true orbit). We find that the atmosphere of the planet can vary significantly in the habitable zone of its parent star, depending on its orbital parameters. We also find that the atmosphere can be highly extended in the habitable zone of a Jupiter-like planet by changing the gravity (period) and planetary mass (recession of the naked body with respect to the true orbit).

This means that we must either eject or capture such bodies. Fortunately, the Sun is an active star with a wide-angle magnetic field. If we point out that the Sun will gradually lose mass over a million years, it is easy to see that solar-like dynamo action will not be able to keep up with the rate at which the Sun is now evolving. Nevertheless, the Sun is on its present evolution path. Therefore, we have to believe that it will be possible to prevent the Sun from losing its current mass by a very slow mechanism.\nThe Earth is a very evolved, mass-rich planet that has experienced an extensive period of atmospheric evolution. Recent observational findings suggest that there is a significant mass loss during this time, although this is not definitive. We investigate the possible sources of mass loss to explore the constraints that could be imposed on the Earth's evolution. We find that the mass loss from the Earth is likely to be determined by its present orbit and has a strong effect on its current orbital architecture and configuration. In addition, the Earth has experienced some kind of gravitational interaction with other planets which may have a significant effect on its orbital configuration.

The presence of a magnetic field in the planet gives rise to a relativistic, dipolar magnetic field, which can be described by a latent variable corresponding to the two free parameters in the planetary magnetosphere: the free parameter of the field and the free parameter of the potential. In this work, we study the evolution of a planet's field and potential while orbiting a star in a circular orbit. We first describe the evolution of the planet's magnetic field and potential in the presence of a stellar wind and a close-in planet, and we then study the magnetic field and potential of the close-in planet, in which the field and potential are freely available. We also derive the appropriate diagnostic for a surface magnetic moment. We find that the evolution of the magnetic field is dominated by the stellar wind field and not by the planetary magnetosphere. As a result, the magnetic moment is a dominant part of the planetary magnetic field, and this leads to a large amount of the magnetic flux being trapped in the stellar corona and dominating the planetary magnetic moment. This leads to a large amount of variation in the planetary orbital circularization timescale, and to a very complex orbit evolution in the presence of a large internal magnetic moment. Finally, we show that the evolution of the planetary orbit is affected by the relative velocity of the stellar wind and the planetary magnetic moment. This is in contrast with the case of close-in Earth-like planets, which orbit very close to their parent star. We also find that the evolution of the planetary orbit is very sensitive to the variations in the stellar wind field.

We also find that the HST/WFC3 spectra show a significantly higher signal-to-noise ratio than the spectra obtained with SPICA. We compare the HST/WFC3 spectra with the spectra obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope/Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph to determine the best-fitting model spectrum. We find that the HST/WFC3 spectrum is best suited for a model with a few elements of similar spectral type and the presence of a magnetic field, while the SPICA spectrum is best fitted for a model with a strong magnetic field.Based on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI), which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555.

This result is in agreement with the Lunar Laser Ranging Experiment (LROE) lunar landing experiment results and is also lower than previous predictions. The method is also accurate to about 0.05% for the two landing sites, and accurate to about 0.01% for the third landing site, both of which are about one to four times as large as the lunar orbital period.\nWe present the first spectroscopic observations of the red giant SDSS J001629.10-01551.3 (SDS-1) and red giant SDSS J014500.93-015016.3 (SDS-2), both with the Magellan/MagA spectrograph on the 3.9-m United Kingdom Infrared Telescope (UKIRT).

If a planet is observed to transit its parent star, the derived mass and radius of the planet can be used to study the planetary orbit and identify which parts of the planet orbit the stellar parent star. Here, we present a new framework to study the orbital architectures of exoplanets and their host stars, using the Kepler multiplanet system as our exoplanet proxy. By combining the stellar mass and radius with the planetary mass and radius, we can compute the stellar and planetary orbital eccentricities and mutual inclination. This framework can be used to study the orbital architectures of exoplanets in a systematic way. We show that the Kepler multiplanet system is compatible with the planet being in a close-in orbit around a close-in giant planet. We also find that the orbital eccentricity of the planet can be well constrained with the Kepler data.\nCassini has been observing Saturn since 2008. During the 2012 summer, Cassini observed two transits of Saturn with the Hi-Iakimaka camera. The total transit depth measured is \u22488.6%. The transit duration is \u224810.5 hr. The transit timing is consistent with a linear ephemeris with the second transit occurring on a spring equinox. The combined transit and ephemeris are used to determine the true transit duration and orbital period. A linear ephemeris with a period of 106 \u00b1 2 min is found from the timing of the radial and radial transit light curves. The transit duration is consistent with the ephemeris. From the transit light curve, the mass loss rate is \u224810-11 g cm-2 s-1.

The habitability of an exoplanet depends on the orbital characteristics and the host star's mass. Aims: Previous studies have shown that the stellar flares on main sequence stars are of the same order as the exoplanet's stellar magnetospheric radio emission. The stellar flares occur during the planet\u2019s orbital transit. Each flare can generate an X-ray to extreme ultraviolet (XUV) flux that can drive a strong atmospheric heat flow and thus affect the planetary atmosphere. When the planet transits in front of the star, the stellar XUV flux can be detected by ground-based telescopes. Methods: To understand the magnitude of the stellar flares, we performed a series of two-dimensional (radian) simulations of the planetary transit with the same stellar XUV flux. We also performed a series of simulations with different XUV fluxes, the same XUV flux as emitted during the planetary transit, and different XUV fluxes with different pulsation frequencies. We also compared the XUV heating parameters that we considered to determine which XUV heating mechanisms are responsible for the observed stellar XUV flux.

This paper considers the case of a disk with hole and rim only because it is the only disk in the literature with both parameters. We also discuss the possible observational signatures of the two models and their probability. We find that the PPDs in the two models are unlikely to be detected by the next generation of direct imaging instruments, but observational signatures of a PPD in a disk with hole and rim are possible. Therefore, we recommend observational tests of the PPDs in this disk.\nWe have used the Gemini Planet Imager (GPI) to acquire a high-resolution (R = 22,500) spectroscopic survey of the Near Infrared M-dwarf analogue of the brown dwarf (BD) > 0.44 M\u2609 .

The light curves were also analysed with the Optimize Spatial Analysis package. We also confirm the previously reported eclipse phase for HAT-P-8b and WASP-85b. Our results for WASP-83b suggest a secondary eclipse depth of about 120 \u00b1 20 ppm, which is smaller than the eclipse depth estimated for the primary eclipse for the planet in the Hubble Space Telescope. We find that the eclipse of HAT-P-7b appears to be delayed by about 2 min, while the eclipse of WASP-84b is expected to be delayed by about 1 min. The eclipse phases of WASP-83b suggest that the planet is expected to have a circular orbit with respect to the orbital plane of the observer.

It is based on the assumption that the planetary radius is proportional to the stellar radius and is therefore independent of stellar parameters, and that it is possible to determine the planet mass from the light curve using the stellar radius and effective temperature. The method was proposed by Peebles and Rushton (1995), and developed further by Blauste et al.

The method is described in detail by Peebles and Rushton (1995), and is applied to the case of HD 209458b, GJ 436b, and GJ 3470b. We also analyse the case of WASP-47b and WASP-84b, which both have long periods and have been suggested to have radii approaching that of Jupiter. We find that the mass and radius of these planets are expected to be in agreement with the results given in the Peebles and Rushton (1999) paper, although the method used by Peebles and Rushton (2004) is strongly suspect and questionable.\nWe report the detection of the secondary eclipse of HAT-P-20b, the first transiting extrasolar planet in an eclipsing binary.

The spectral features for the average BOSS candidate consist of the first 2.5 in the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopy (BOSS) catalogue, the second 2.5 in the CSD catalog and data from the other two surveys. The average BOSS features are of the order of 2\u00d710-3, and the BOSS candidates appear to be highly concentrated in the CSD and CSD/CSD(V) surveys.

We use a multi-dimensional smoothed particle hydrodynamics code that allows us to model the dynamics of the disc as it would appear to a near-infrared (IR) survey.

These results indicate that the disk is dynamically turbulent, and that the gas is predominantly carried by the spiral arms at the surface. We find that the gas is still sufficiently close to the surface as to be affected by small dust grains, which cause the gas density in the spiral arms to decrease with time. The gas mass in the spiral arms is not constant with time, and the radial pressure gradient in the spiral arms can be modified by the presence of small grains. The time-dependent time-dependent gas properties are used to estimate the lifetime of the gas in the spiral arms, and hence the composition of the gas in the disk.

We find that it has a significant effect on the evolution of the accretion stream from small to large distances from the nucleus. The stream size is determined by the length of the accretion stream, which is the inverse square root of the mass of the accretion stream. The accretion stream is proportional to the mass of the accretion stream, which is a direct consequence of the mass accretion rate. We understand the evolution of the accretion rate by employing a Monte Carlo simulation, and we find that it is sensitive to the total mass of the accretion stream. We give an analytical estimate of the evolution of the accretion rate from the nucleus to the planet, using the results of our simulation. We also find that the mass accretion rate is sensitive to the initial radius of the planet and the mass accretion rate. We find that the mass accretion rate is nearly independent of the initial radius of the planet, but it is sensitive to the initial radius.\nWe have obtained a detailed model for a lunar escape in the Enceladus/Saturn mass-ratio system, using the two-stream approximation.

For a planet with a radius of 0.3 au and an inclination of 90\u00b0, the tidal torque is applied to the planet\u2019s orbit as a result of the change in the planet\u2019s orbital semimajor axis.

The tidal torque is proportional to e2*2f2 with the unit sign representing the ratio of tidal and magnetic energy fluxes. The modal factor of the tidal torque is independent of the planet\u2019s orbital eccentricity and can be expressed as a polynomial function of the planet\u2019s radius and inclination. We find that the modal factor of the tidal torque is proportional to e2*,2f2. Since the tidal torque is directly proportional to the inverse of e, we formulate a polynomial function of e2*2f2 as a function of the planet\u2019s orbital eccentricity and conclude that the modal factor of the tidal torque is proportional to e2*2f2. We use numerical simulations to study the effect of the planetary orbit on the tidal torque and investigate its dependence on the planetary mass.

We present a PYTRANSIT satellite-based toolkit to enable the temporal sampling of high-precision stellar spectra, which has already been tested on simulated stellar spectra. We also present a new Open-Source Python toolkit to facilitate the statistical analysis of large time-series data sets.\nWe report the detection of an 8.3 day periodic radial velocity (RV) signal in the TESS light curve, which is not seen in the photometric data. The most complete light curve, which covers 13 days, can be fitted with a single-period model that is slightly more complex than the one originally fitted by Lillo-Box et al. (2013, A&amp;A, 513, A30) from the first and second data sets. We find that the RV variations that are best explained by the model with the lower period are smooth with a period of P = 6.963 \u00b1 0.005 d and amplitude of a few m s-1. The period of the other variability is much longer, with a period of 3.636 \u00b1 0.007 d and amplitude. We also find that the model with the higher period is significantly more complex, with a period of P = 10.974 \u00b1 0.014"}, {"Input": "", "Output": "The effect of a mixed system of planets on a binary system is investigated using three-dimensional smoothed particle hydrodynamics. The equations describing the three-dimensional equations are solved for the case of the binary system containing planets, taking into account the choice of the parameter and the choice of the smoothed factor. The results obtained indicate that planets can be classified as a combination of the two case, with the exception of mass ratios very close to that of the two case, which is very rare. The mixed system can be dynamical in the sense that it can contain planets that can move about in the system. In addition, it is possible to have planets that can have a very close orbit as a result of tidal circularization. The results indicate that the tidal circularization time can be a very short time scale.\nWe show that the strong tidal circularization problem can be studied for planetesimals in non-rotating discs. The problem can be approached by means of the freer transfer functions, which we call the free transfer functions. We also show that, in non-rotating discs, the free transfer functions are necessarily coupled to the disc and cannot be directly computed from the central meridian. Instead, the free transfer functions can be approximated by the sum of the two terms of a linear least-squares procedure that has been found to be effective in reducing the Fourier components of the linear least-squares fitting function.\nWe report the results of a series of simulations of the gravitational quadrupole interaction between two planets, which use the minimal two-dimensional approximation of de Bruijneis and Gautier. This method allows us to study the resonant evolution of the system with the use of a simple analytical model. We study the parameter space with the two planets and set up the system at different orbital separations. We then perform a series of numerical integrations of the results of the simulations to test the accuracy of the approach. We find that the results are consistent with the analysis of the standard quadratic problem assuming the two planets are placed"}, {"Input": "", "Output": "The construction of the GALAH survey is described.

This candidate is a new member of the \u03b2 Pictoris moving group with a spectral type of F5-F7.5, and is an M2.5V dwarf found in the Kepler field. We have obtained the following photometry and radial velocity measurements: (1) Three transits were obtained with the Keck I Telescope in 2008 January. (2) A radial velocity (RV) of 2.7 \u00b1 0.3 m s-1 was measured the following month. (3) A transit was obtained in 2011 June. (4) In 2012 August, a new RV measurement of 3.0 \u00b1 1.3 m s-1 was measured. The new RV measurement is consistent with a circular orbit and is the first for this candidate. The star is at a distance of 7.4 \u00b1 1.8 pc and the mass (Mp = 0.45 \u00b1 0.07 M\u2609) is in agreement with other recent determinations. A parallax of 12.5 \u00b1 2.3 mas yields a distance of 5.1 \u00b1 0.6 pc. The accurate trigonometric parallax of 12.5 \u00b1 2.3 mas is corrected for 0.35 pc for a distance of 13.1 \u00b1 2.3 pc.

With an orbital period of P = 515549.597 \u00b1 0.010 d, KIC 8579988 b is the second planet detected around an M dwarf. The two planets are comoving and have a period that is too long to be due to mean motion resonances. The host star also exhibits a strong activity cycle, with a period of 29.5 \u00b1 0.4 d and a phase offset of 0.252 \u00b1 0.002 days. The system is associated with a previously reported planet candidate. The two planets are thus in a 4:1 mean motion resonance. The unbiased mass-radius relationship of the system is supported by both our dynamical and photometric constraints. The planetary companion has a minimum mass of 62 \u00b1 4 MJup and a semimajor axis of 0.054-0.011+0.014 AU. The planet and companion have a period P2 = 147575.9298 \u00b1 0.00017 d and a separation of 0.928-0.008+0.010 AU, respectively. Assuming that the system is coplanar, the system parameters are used to derive a robust lower limit of the planetary mass lower limit to be 3.9 \u00b1 0.4 MJup. This is \u22481.3\u03c3 below the planet's mean density. We also find that the system is stable to within \u223c1% on long timescales.

In this article, we briefly review the observational constraints provided by theoretical models and models of dynamical instabilities (DI) in planetary systems. We then briefly summarize the most recent theoretical developments.\nWe reexamine the excitation of radiation by relativistic and coronal disruptions in Brownian-like shock compression"}, {"Input": "", "Output": "The geographic distribution of the starspots on the stellar surface is studied using the photometric data from the free-electron path (FEP) of the SOHO Echelle Spectrograph on the 3.6-m Anglo-Australian Telescope. The area seen in the Echelle diagram is found to be approximately equal to that of the circularly-proportional spot at the equator. This finding is in agreement with the mean appearance of the spots on the stellar surface seen in the corresponding photometric data by other surveys.\nThe recent discovery of several new superflares on the Sun suggests that solar-like stars, with a much larger area of influence, can produce multiple superflares on a much shorter timescale. If such a large area of influence is not maintained over many orbits because of the magnetorotational instability (MRI), then the observed superflares may lead to a fusion of two or more superflares into one superstorm. Here, we study the evolution of superstorm systems following their formation. We find that the evolution depends strongly upon the initial plasma flow. For a particle-filled disk, the evolution is determined by the drag force of the disk on the star and the internal energy of the disk. For an empty disk, the evolution is determined by the magnesium abundance. We find that the evolution can be well approximated by the simplified equation (Bode, S. [2008]. Astrophys. J. 571, 42), although a more sophisticated treatment is needed to determine whether it is valid. We also find that the exponential growth rate is in the range 1.1 \u00d7 10-7 to 5.6 \u00d7 10-6 M\u2609 yr-1.\nContext. The origin of superflares on solar-type stars is still a matter of debate. The recent discovery of a new superflare on V830 Tau suggests that the frequency of superflares may increase with the stellar properties, which is in accordance with the results of magneto-hydrodynamics simulations.

We characterize the properties of these sources and estimate the distance and mass transfer rates that they accreted. The analysis also shows that the UV-C sources are relatively fast rotators, which makes them interesting as potential targets for future follow-up observations. We also find that the UV-C sources are not the only ones with UV-C photospheric emission detected by the VLA. We discuss the current status of the VLA observations and their potential for further discovery of UV-C sources.\nContext. Oscillations in hot, rapidly rotating stars may be a useful tracer of the stellar magnetism. It has been argued that stars with extreme rotation velocities (v \u2a86 100 km s-1) may be magnetically active. Aims: We attempt to study the evolution of stellar magnetic activity in such stars by studying the cyclic variations in chromospheric activity. Methods: We used photometric observations from the UV-C medium-resolution spectrograph ULTRACAM as well as spectroscopic observations from the HARPS and HIRES spectrographs. We determined the activity levels of the stars in our sample by comparing their photometric activity indicators (H\u03b1, H\u03b2, H\u03b3, H\u03bb, and H\u03b1/H\u03b2, respectively). We computed the rotational velocities of the stars and compared them with the values obtained from spectroscopic observations. We also characterized the chromospheric activity of the stars using their chromospheric activity indicators. Results: The UV-C observations clearly detect the cyclic variations in chromospheric activity. The activity evolution is shown to be different for stars with high v\u2a86 100 km s-1 and low v\u2a86 100 km s-1. A linear correlation between chromospheric activity and rotation is observed for the latter two types of stars.

This will allow for the characterisation of the chemical evolution of the planet atmospheres and the derivation of their origin. In this work, we analyse the metallicity and abundances of methane, sulphur and smog, and the chemical evolution of exoplanets with different chemical compositions. We consider the effects of the formation of gas giant planets in a gaseous disc and its effect on the planet's composition and on the formation of their atmospheres. We show that the abundances of metals and silicates in the atmospheres of the gas giants are not constant as a function of the formation location, but can evolve significantly due to the evolution of the disc gas mass, which is much larger than the mass of the disc itself. We also find that the metallicity and abundances of smog in the atmospheres of the gas giants are not identical depending on the formation location of the planet. We therefore conclude that the abundances of smog elements are not a constant function of the planet's metallicity.\nWe present a study of transit light curves of the hot-Jupiter WASP-1b using the XMM-Newton and Chandra observatories. This was done in a straightforward manner, searching for an asymmetry in the transit light curve caused by the planet's orbital motion relative to the observer. There is evidence for an asymmetry in the transit light curve, but we did not detect it in the radial-velocity data. In the XMM-Newton data, we observe a small asymmetry, with the planet occulting part of the stellar disk and the stellar disk occulting the entire disk. We show that the XMM-Newton transit light curve is well fit by an isotropic blackbody, while the radial-velocity light curve is well fitted by a linear combination of the blackbody with a sinusoid"}]}
